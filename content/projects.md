### How-tos/other stuff

In my quest to make this weblog better and just general nerdery, I've documented some of the processes here for someone else to read and learn from. Enjoy!

#### [Tweeting from Discord](/2016/01/tweeting-from-discord/)

#### [Middleman Linklog RSS](/2016/01/middleman-linklog-rss-fix/)

A quick way to get RSS working in a link post like way. Also a way to write more readable RSS for [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com)

#### [Getting IFTTT to work right with link posts](/2016/01/getting-twitter-to-work-right-with-link-posts/)

A way to make sure that link posts automatically tweeted with [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/) point to this site instead of the link.

#### [Responsive sidebar](/2015/12/responsive-sidebar/)

A quick, inelegant and dirty jQuery script to have the sidebar for a website be responsive.

A way to have a Middleman site with the Blog extension work right with [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview).

#### [Responsive images](/2015/10/responsive-images/)

A precursor to [images that span the whole width of the screen](/2015/12/images-that-span-the-whole-width/). These images fit to the screen size. Sometimes that's all you need.
