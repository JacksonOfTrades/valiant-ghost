![iA Writer theme for Typora](/images/ia_typora.jpg)

In the interest of creating relative consistency across the writing environment of both my desktop and PC, I made a slightly modified version of iA Writer's theme for [Typora](/2016/01/writing-here-with-typora/), which I use almost daily. As Typora's themes are simple CSS, it was fairly easy to spin one up in an afternoon. I kept the main column narrow and used [Courier Prime](http://www.quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/) for the font, as it achieved the monospaced look of iA Writer's Nitti font whilst keeping up the minimalist look. I made the theme in a light and dark mode because writing at 2am while staring at the sun is not fun. Unfortunately, I had to add a dashed border along the top and bottom of the YAML frontmatter because otherwise it was hard to easily tell where the front matter ended and your actual post began.

You can download the theme either [directly](/projects/iatypora.zip) or get it on [Github](https://github.com/Summonee/iA-Writer-theme-for-Typora/).

To install the theme, extract the contents of the .zip file into your Typora folder, which you can find in Typora by going Themes > Open themes folder. Simply extract all the documents into that folder and then change the theme to either the day theme or the night theme.
