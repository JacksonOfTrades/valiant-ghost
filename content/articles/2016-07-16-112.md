Also while I was in Christchurch I went to a little coffee shop called [A Mouse called Bean](http://www.amousecalledbean.co.nz/index.html) and got my standard order of a Mocha with two sugars and two sweeteners. But the catch was that this coffee shop had a standard of triple shot. And while it gave me heartburn, I can say that it was ***THE BEST COFFEE I'VE EVER DRANK!***. Go there if you go to Christchurch.
