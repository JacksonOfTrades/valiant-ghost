Mark Llobrera, A List Apart:

> Sometimes the writing comes easily, and then there’s the last two months. I really wondered if I had run out of things to say. I knew I wanted to write about how more web designers and developers need to write about their work. So I wrote a bunch of paragraphs down, and then on a lark (I’m not even a regular listener), I downloaded [episode 110 of The Web Ahead](http://www.thewebahead.net/110).
> 
> I nodded along with host Jen Simmons and guest Jeremy Keith saying some very smart things about the web and its roots as the El train cut across Philadelphia. But at the 48-minute mark things got weird, because Jen and Jeremy basically started writing my column for me while I listened.

I love this. A rather inspirational piece on why you should just write, even if what you're writing is half-baked.
