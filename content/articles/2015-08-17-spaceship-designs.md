The hotel I'm currently staying at has a Spaceship. Freakin' Spaceships man, how do you use them? Seriously, no sane man could conceivable come up with a such a design monstrosity such as that. It seems unnatural.

You are probably asking by now: *What does he mean by Spaceships?*

They're freakin' Spaceships man!

Okay, so that's obviously not the most obvious answer. By Spaceships I mean over complex showers that you cannot use without help or about 10 minutes of staring straight at it, turning ever dial and pulling every switch until you find the one that cascades either freezing cold or scalding hot water down your back. 

For example my current hotel, which is quite nice, has a Spaceship. First, the layout of it seems unnatural. The handles look like eyes, the tap looks like a mouth, this weird round lever thing which becomes important later and finally a long metal pipe which connects part of the tap to the shower head. Turning either of the very low handles does not give off water from the shower head, but instead sprays freezing water on your feet. 

What you need to do to get nice water coming out of the shower head is raise the lever a lot, then turn the handles in order to get freezing cold or scalding hot water on your back, unless you dart back fast enough and manage to not slip over. It's a shower that took me ten minutes to figure out. And that's not normal.

That's a Spaceship.
