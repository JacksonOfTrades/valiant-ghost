*Welcome to* The Right Tool For The Job *a column series where I attempt to give a highly objective analysis and review of a weapon from an anime series, eventually leading up to the question of whether I myself would use it.*

Awwww, such a cute doggie...

HOLY SHIT NO!

**Magical Beast Transformation: Hekatonkheires**, affectionately known as Koro by its owner Seryu Ubiquitous, is a biological Imperial Arm[^3] from the anime and manga series Akame Ga Kill. In its incredibly cute 'inactive' form, Koro is a cartoonish oval shaped dog suffering from the disease known as [Super-deformed](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed), standing on its short hind legs with which it is able to walk but not keep up with a running Seryu.  While it's cutesy and small form seem to show a lack of mouth, during brief moments of intelligence it has been shown to have a disturbingly large one, with  an adequately large pair of chompers to back it up.

But just like it's owner, Koro has a dark and twisted side underneath the initially flippantly happy personality. When it comes to fighting, the super deformation is removed to show a spikes teethed dog which is pure muscle, the kind which old-school banner ads told me professional trainers hate. In this form, Koro becomes pure muscle, able to take near all the blows and bullets, all the wounds took regenerating, until the core located in it head is destroyed. At Seryu's commands, he can get even more ripped than he was before in a specified area[^1].

When Koro's 'Trump Card'  is activated he gets even more gains than before. Here it's damage and regeneration rate is increased significantly. It's rather rounded oval like appearance is removed and what we are given is a full-fledged RED DEMON HORROR WOLF OF DOOM. In this form its strong and features a shark like multiple rows of teeth, around a cylindrical mouth. 

Koro also operates as a rather handy and cute bag of holding. After Dr. Stylish modifies the body of both Seryu and Koro, the dog holds a number of Incredibly large weapons inside its body. Seryu can call these forth by calling out a number and holding out her arm, which causes Koro to grow to its big evil size and bite onto her arm, forming the gun. 

### Would I use it?

Sure I would, if the damn thing would let me. Koro is notoriously picky at who chooses[^2] but if I was allowed by Koro to be its owner I would love to be. In its normal form it is small, cute and extremely portable. Plus it would be handy as luggage on a plane. 

### HEKATONKHEIRES/KORO

<span style="font-size:3em">10</span>

* Convenient bag of holding

Cons:

* Is picky about its owner.


[^1]: For example, Seryu simply says 'Arms' and his arms bulk up in such a way so quickly that professional body builders shudder in lust.

[^2]: The Empire had such trouble finding an owner for Koro that they had to go to the lower ranks until they eventually found Seryu.
[^3]: Or Taigu, depending on where you watched it. For me if was Crunchyroll, where they were the Imperial Arms.
