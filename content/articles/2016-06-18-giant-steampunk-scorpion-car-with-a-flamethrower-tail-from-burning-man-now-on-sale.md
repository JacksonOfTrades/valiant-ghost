From EBay, this ridiculously awesome beast that has featured at Burning Man since 2011 is now on sale:

> Built on a 1991, 28 foot long International boom truck, the Scorpion is a 55 feet long, 22-45 feet wide, 39-45 feet tall exact replica of a female emperor scorpion named Fluffy.  The Scorpion boasts a computer controlled 7 gun flame thrower off the tail, 21 hydraulic points which make the arms, legs, and claws all move in a sinister spider manner including hydraulics which make the entire truck lift off the ground to produce the most eerie of effects. The project is “skinned”- as in made to look like an exact replica of a female emperor Scorpion with artistically placed and sculpted metal sheathing. The final touches are a steam punk look with rivets, textured fabrics and a patterned, oozy and highly mesmerizing multi- color light show. 

My vehicle of choice right here, folks. Unfortunately it's not street legal and you need to somehow get it from Burning Man to your house, but hey. Giant steampunk scorpion with a flamethrower for a tail. Do you not want to own this?
