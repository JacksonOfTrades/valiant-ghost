Picture this: its 4am, the indescribable period where you're not quite sure if itâ€™s late at night or early in the morning. I should've gone to bed hours ago, but I thought that if I stay up I could finish this website I was trying to make using Material Design. Earlier in the day I tried to make it with [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) and when that didn't work [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/) came to save the day[^1].

Websites nearly finished. I glance over at the [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) tab from earlier in the day. Thinking I was so clever to try and register ```jacksonw.xyz``` but some bastard had already registered it. A ```.xyz``` domain is only 1 dollar, I could maybe use another one. For some reason I try ```alucard.xyz```. It's open! Do I add it to the cart...

Okay, so I got that. And ```hellsing.xyz```. May as well buy it to complete ```Alucard.xyz```. Am I ever going to use them? Probably not. I may as well buy a domain I'm actually going to use. Somehow I thought ```animeandcoffee.xyz``` was a good idea, maybe I could start a dedicated anime blog with it. Hm, another ```.space``` domain would be nice, maybe ```animeandcoffeeinouter.space?``` That's also cool and I might be able to use it for an anime blog. Cool!

I woke up at 10 today, regretting staying up to that time in its entirety. Shuffle over to my computer. First thing I see: receipt from Namecheap for the four domains I bought last night. It only cost me 5 dollars.

I don't get drunk, I get tired. Same thing really.

[^1]: I think Materialize may have been the better framework but MDL, as opposed to Materialize which kept messing up
