> You can search for queries like “how do I make a Manhattan?” or “how do I make a whiskey sour?” google shows you the drink description and information about its history. And google will even tell you what type of glass to pour the drink in and the proper garnish. When I searched for how to make a Manhattan, google told me it is made with whiskey, sweet vermouth, bitters and should be garnished with a maraschino cherry in a cocktail glass straight up without ice. google said that the most-searched cocktail so far this year is the Moscow Mule. This is followed by the Margarita and the Bloody Mary.

Well then, your queries as to what kind of alcohol goes in what shall be answered even quicker by Google now. And unlike the lyric service (I'm not bitter) this actually works.
