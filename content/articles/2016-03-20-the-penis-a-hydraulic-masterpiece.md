M. Sophia Newman, *The Atlantic*:

> The erection is a miracle of evolutionary biology. So advantageous is the inflatable penis, in fact, that it’s evolved independently in several corners of the animal kingdom—including mammals, turtles, and archosaurs (a group that includes birds and crocodiles), to name a few examples. Erect, the penis is “a virtually puncture-proof balloon that can be re-inflated at will,” the journalist David M. Friedman wrote in A Mind of Its Own: A Cultural History of the Penis, “no matter how often it has gone flat in the past, and why.”

> The means by which the penis becomes erect are well known, stretching back to Leonardo da Vinci’s 15th-century anatomical drawings, and to the work of Regnier de Graaf, who “produced the most thorough investigation of the penis to date” in 1668, as Friedman writes. Soon after that, de Graaf’s student Fredrik Ruysch created wax anatomical models based on cadaver dissections. These models “showed the expanding and shrinking organ to be a marvel of hydraulic engineering,” Friedman writes, thereby helping to disprove the then-widespread theory that “air” or “wind” causes erections.
