Amy Ellis Nutt, *The Washington Post*:

> In one challenge, the youths maneuver through a maze of corridors, searching for bright green dollar signs. Another tests their ability to recognize an error on the screen. All the while, the scanner is photographing “slices” of their brains. The ultimate reward is far more than a game: In the first clinical trial of its kind, those multi-band images are mapping the unknown territory of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Interesting to know that the cause is unknown, especially for someone with severe to mild OCD. But I have always assumed to some extent it was the result of some misfire in my brain of the neural circuits of the brain.
