I've considered maybe starting to write on [Medium](https://medium.com/). But two things stopped me. 
<ul>

<li>1. I don't think you can successfully linklog on Medium.</li>

<li>2. That would mean all the effort spent designing my sites theme, and programming in linklogging functionality would be for nil.</li>

</ul>
Something about a post I read on the candler blog today, called [The Internet Sucks](http://www.candlerblog.com/2015/07/17/the-internet-sucks/) which really struck home why I shouldn't convert to Medium, and made me remember why I started on the path to Jekyll/Octopress/Middleman. It was my own, the Valiant Ghost I made there was my own, my own writing, my own words, hell even my own theme. I wrote it. And for now, and the foreseeable future, I'm sticking with it.

When I started making Valiant Ghost back in 2013 it was with [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) on the day of release. I loved it. I loved the fact that what I wrote was mine, even if it was only on my computer. Valiant Ghost has been on a roller coaster ride, going from [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) to [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/). And through it all, its been mine. The crappy theme(s), the writing, the code, all mine. All the times I've thought of writing on Medium, I just remember all the damn code I had to write to get linklogging working on Middleman.

And that gets me to stay.
