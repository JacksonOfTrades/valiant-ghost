Why do I use [Neat Bourbon](http://neat.bourbon.io/) on this site? It's 90% so I can say "Valiant Ghost is made with coffee (physical) and bourbon (digital)". 

It's not a lie[^1]() but on a serious note I do use it because it is a slightly easier version of [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/). I briefly used Susy on this site (A day or two, see below codepen for how it looked) but I found it too hard. I am not a good designer[^2]. I have enough experience with HTML and CSS to be able to write websites but when it comes to Susy and making that look nice I have no clue. So I use Bourbon. It's like Susy in that it allows me to make responsive but not like other frameworks in that I don't have to fill the HTML source with heaps of ```div``` classes to get a sidebar.

A lot of people prefer Susy to Neat. I prefer it the other way around. For me its easier to make it look better. Maybe in a few years I'll use Susy to make websites. But right now Neat fits me perfectly.

[^1]: I do say this to people when they ask what I make my websites with.

[^2]: Just looking at this website should give you an idea of how lacking my design skills are. I say its minimalist but thats really because I have no idea how to hit the point between plain and flashy that is minimalist.
