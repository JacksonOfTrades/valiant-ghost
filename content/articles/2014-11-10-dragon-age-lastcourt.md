It's not bad, actually. Its like a choose your own adventure game, where you play as the Marquis of Serault (A town in Orlais[^1]). Your goal is to get enough resources for when the Divine (the games Pope) comes , along with restore the Honor of Serault.

It plays like a mobile game. You have certain number of turns and you gain another turn every 20 minutes. Of course, you can buy 'Dawn' to refresh your points, which cost real world money.

This might not be for everyone, but I find it quite fun. Fun enough to fill the gap in between now and Inquisition.

[^1]: The games France, in accent and design.
