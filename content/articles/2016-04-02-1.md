So, my first microblog post. Ever since I started reading [Manton Reece's blog](http://manton.org/) I've wanted to try out microblogging, because it seemed really cool, low effort twitter style posts on your own blog. Perfect, kind of like why I prefer this place as linkblog rather than a normal weblog. After a bit of messing around in Middleman's code I finally managed to get this to work, and I'll publish a post on how I did it soon.

Anyway, Manton did his [30 days of coffeeshops](http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin) so what can I do? Microreviews. As I watch a lot of anime I figured I could write my thoughts about each episode, but instead of long posts like some sites do[^1], I'll shorten it down to only my base thoughts, music, themes, direction. 

I'll probably be following Manton's [guide on microblogs](http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html) with everything, but the character limit probably, which this post has well exceeded.

Anyway, we'll see how this goes. First up in my Microreviews: [Chaika](myanimelist.net/anime/20853/Hitsugi_no_Chaika?q=Chaika).

[^1]: Some websites I read do a review for each episode, which on top of sounding like a lot of work I personally would rather just read a review of the entire series, rather than singular episodes.
