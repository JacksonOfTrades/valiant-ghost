As I have been informed, the reward for completing the current Fate/Grand Order event Fate/Accel Zero Order is Irisviel from the original Fate/Zero anime and light novel. She's a four star Caster with a lot of Grail related attack. Cool, but not sure if I should replace Helana with Iri just yet, considering they're both four star Casters and I like Helena. If anyone knows which is better please let me know.
