Kwame Opam writing for *The Verge* on how the First Lady conquered social media during her reign:

> George W. Bush was the president you could get a beer with, but no one accused him or Laura of being cool. Bill Clinton was personable, but his cool ended at playing the sax. Hillary’s cool is detached and technocratic, raw power wielding a Blackberry behind sunglasses on a private jet. But the Obamas are different: the president reportedly texts with Jay Z and calls private meetings with Kendrick Lamar — his favorite rapper — in the Oval Office; the First Lady counts Beyoncé as a personal friend, and isn’t afraid to show off some Mom Dances on The Tonight Show. Kyle Lierman, the White House’s associate director of public engagement, says the Obamas are “uniquely able to be authentic, in a bunch of new ways and through a bunch of new channels."

I'll be sad to see this lady go from the White House, but it's no doubt that she will be remembered as awesome.
