Marco Arment:

> As software creeps into ever more objects in my daily life and makes them more capable yet more disposable and less reliable than ever, it’s nice to have something that does less, always works, never needs a software update, requires no cables, doesn’t need to be charged, and whose useful life will probably be longer than mine.

Yes! Despite the fact I'm a massive watch person I have little desire to get a smartwatch because the same old mechanical watches[^1] I've worn for years has done what I've needed it to do: tell time. 

I've tried smartwatches before, and while the added functionality does provide you with some handy tools right in your wrist, I'd rather not sacrifice the sexiness of my phyiscal watch for a digital, slightly ugly looking thing that can be used as pedometer[^2]. 

My idea's of a watch align pretty much up with what [Khoi Vinh at Subtraction](http://www.subtraction.com/) said in his post about [the Apple Watch](http://www.subtraction.com/2015/09/24/why-i-dont-own-an-apple-watch/): a watch should be round and shouldn't require any extra maintenance on the part of the owner, which the smartwatches have not been. My current watch, a Rotary Aquaspeed, doesn't need to be charged at the end of the day like my phone does, the matter of the fact is it hardly ever needs to leave my wrist. I could wear it at any time and at any place and it would not be damaged at all. 

I like my watch, it does what I need to do: say "Hey Jackson, its 15:55" whenever I look at it. The simplicity and sexiness of this watch, currently on my wrist, with the red second hand ticking around in a circle towards 12 is enough for a simple soul like me.





[^1]: Sometimes substituted by a digital watch but I try not to think of those days.
[^2]: I carry my 3DS around with me everywhere anyway. Gotta get them coin bruh!
