Do you remember Segways? I sure as hell do, mostly from "Wierd Al" Yankovic's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9qYF9DZPdw">White & Nerdy</a> and occasionally at [Scitech](http://www.scitech.org.au/) when I went.

Well, now there's mini ones. And they look a hell of a lot better than the old ones of days gone past, those huge old clunky bike things.
