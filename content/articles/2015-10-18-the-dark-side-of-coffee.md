Alexander J Myers, writing on The Conversation:

> <p>The humble coffee bean is one of the most important and <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-198849799.html">actively traded</a> commodities in the world. It doesn’t take more than a glance at American coffee consumption stats to understand why.</p>

> <p>In a 2015 <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/184388/americans-coffee-consumption-steady-few-cut-back.aspx">Gallup poll</a>, 64% of Americans reported drinking at least one cup of coffee per day and 2.7 on average. The United States imports about 2.8 billion pounds of green coffee every year, and Americans consume just over nine pounds of coffee per capita <a href="http://www.ico.org/prices/new-consumption-table.pdf">annually</a>.</p>

> <p>If you’re anything like me, your morning coffee is a necessity, so early in my graduate career I decided to do a little research on it. I found a fascinating and somewhat disturbing story encompassing ecology, economics, globalization and finance – one that all coffee drinkers should know about.</p>
