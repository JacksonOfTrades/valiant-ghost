So for the past month or so now I've used a browser I've been meaning to try for about a year. 

It's a browser designed for power users and made by the guys who made [Opera](http://www.opera.com), so you know its going to be a strong, fun browser to use. If you follow [me on twitter](https://twitter.com/ManOTheClassics) at all, you know what it is.

And... I really don't know why I'm not telling you the name of it because it's in the post title anyway.

The browser is [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/). And it's awesome.

### A brief history

Vivaldi is made by the same guys who made Opera, and just like Opera means Vivaldi is built on top of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/), allowing for Chrome Extensions to be used, alleviating some of the anxiety of moving browsers. This means you can still use [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) and [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) in this new browser, along with importing history can make it seem like a faster, better chrome. But of course, it's not just another Opera or Chrome, that's what the creators set out to stop. There're many upsides to having something different.

### What makes it different?

Vivaldi is a browser meant for the productive power user and multitasker. Firstly, I'm going to go on about my favorite thing: **WEB PANELS**. Web Panels are, for all intents and purposes a side window that opens alongside the main window, when not in use displayed as a tiny button on the left of the screen. It's incredibly handy for displaying two windows side by side, or just having a separate window. I, for instance, have one for Tweetdeck, meaning no matter what I'm searching I always have a streaming twitter feed right there. I can also have my analytics there for this site, meaning I can quickly peek in and see how this sites doing.

Along with Web Panels, there is also tab stacking, where you can group multiple tabs. On top of keeping your tab bar nice and neat, you can also see every single tab at once in its own column, from two to twenty.

As you may have learning [during my twidere review](/2016/02/twidere/) customisation is one of my favorite things in an application I'm going to be using a lot. Simply going into settings gives us a plethora of options to choose from. Want the tabs to be the color of the website or just a plain color? There's a setting, no it will actually set itself automatically to the color of the web page[^1] . Want the bookmarks bar to be at the bottom of the screen? It's even possible to go around the entire browser with only your keyboard. Perfectly customisable.

Another handy feature is the ability to hibernate tabs. This is basically killing the tabs process in order to save memory. You can either kill individual tabs, a stack or multiple by ctrl + clicking the tabs. Handy as hell for Laptops.

There's also a slew of keyboard combinations you can use, or get help by pressing F2. Vivaldi is fully keyboard navigatable, which was helpful to me a few weeks ago when my old laptop broke and the touchpad was disconnected. Pressing F2 allows you to navigate your open tabs, stack tabs, Google stuff and a hell of a lot more.

On a slightly negative note, there's no way to sync your Vivaldi bookmarks and history across devices yet, but it is currently in the works. You can however import your bookmarks and history from other browser with sync, meaning you can at least pull your history over.

### Have fun

I've recommended this browser to a few internet friends and so far they have loved it, swearing to never turn back to Chrome. Even if you aren't sure about switching away from your beloved browser, at least, give it a shot. It's [free and in beta](https://vivaldi.com/). Even if you didn't like, well what did you lose?
