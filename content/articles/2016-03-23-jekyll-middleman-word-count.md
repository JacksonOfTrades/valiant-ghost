One of my main problems with Middleman is never knowing how many words I have actually written for this site. Fortunatly Justin Blanton has wrote a basic python script to spit out the results. Make sure you set the path to the root directory[^1] to get an accurate words.

At the current time of writing my word count is 56,566 words. Not including quotes, annoyingly.
