People on Twitter and Reddit even began joking that he was blind or could not read. I don’t care for Steve Harvey, but I’m not so sure it is really his fault. I was immediately reminded of this line from Don Norman’s legendary*The* *Design of Everyday Things,*

I don't follow Miss Universe, nor do I really know who Steve Harvey is, but this clearly shows how it's not even in the slightest Harvey's fault. Just like in web design, bad design negatively effected the user experience, but in this case it put all the blame on one individual instead of where it should be placed, on the design team.
