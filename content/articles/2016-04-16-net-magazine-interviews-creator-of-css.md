Oliver Lindberg for Net Magazine interviews Håkon Wium Lie, the creator of CSS: 

> When it comes to web design, few people have been more important or influential than [Håkon Wium Lie](http://people.opera.com/howcome/). Working at CERN alongside Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web itself, Lie is the man who gave it its familiar look by inventing CSS.

>  But despite many years fighting to improve the web, if you ask him if it’s still in need of saving, he’s adamant: “Yes! Constantly! It’s a constant job! It’s not like the web has been done. This is history in the making. The web is only 25 years old. It’s going to be around for a long time, so there are lots of things to develop.”


> New threats to the web, he believes, come from commercial technologies, such as the rise of iPhone apps, which allow you to do things you can’t do with HTML and CSS. But the good news is that the web standards community has continually fought back against such commercial encroachments.


> “For years, iPhone apps had access to the camera, and web apps didn’t, ” he says. “Now we have access to the camera, the location, the accelerometer. So now you can technically write most of the apps out there with HTML. One of the things we’re missing is the page orientation. We need to do those compelling visual presentations that they can do in apps, make sure we can do the same in HTML and CSS.”

Thank god for CSS. Can you imagine if all websites looked the same[^1]? Twitter, Facebook and Valiant Ghost all looking kind of the same? A nightmare.  

He also has some points on an argument I hear a lot, native vs the web, which is nerd speak for what your phone's apps can do vs what a similar app on the web can do. Personally, while native is awesome I think that the web will 'beat' native. The Web is just... too cool and dynamic and *human*.
