Ryan F. Mandelbaum on detecting how we fight against the counterfeit coffee surge affecting the world:

> Servillo’s team prepared a mixture of each species of bean with formic acid and water, then passed it through a [high-performance liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_liquid_chromatography)(HPLC) instrument. Specific properties cause different coffee chemicals to move faster or slower through the instrument. The researchers use how quickly the chemical passes through a detector to determine what it's made of — like how you can tell whether you’re drinking soda or a milkshake based on how quickly it travels through the straw.


> The group observed 20 times more [homostachydrine](http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB33433) (a harmless, naturally occurring chemical) in the Robusta beans than in the Arabica beans. They also noted that the chemical remained even after roasting. Servillo’s team was able to use the chemical to verify the percentage of each bean advertised in store-bought blends, like “100 percent Arabica” vs. “60 percent Arabica, 40 percent Robusta.”

I'll have to remember to take my high end chemistry set with me next time I go to the café.
