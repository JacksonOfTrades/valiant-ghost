Wanna fly, kid? But don't wanna get more then a few inches above the ground? Well Lexus, yes its the same Lexus who makes the car you possibly drive, has built a hoverboard just for you.

> Yes, it's kind of a trick. Yes, it only works on a very special track. No, it is not going to be for sale. But damned if it is not wildly awesome regardless. 

Now you're probably wondering, how in gods name does such an iconic sci-fi thing work? Well the answer is simple. Kind of. The physics behind it is that inside the board are two reservoirs which contain super conducting material kept at -197 degrees Celsius through being submerged in liquid nitrogen. However, it can only function within a magnetic field, like a giant magnetic skate park, so unfortunately you won't be rolling down Main Street on your sweet as hoverboard. [This explains the science of it better](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a16177/is-the-lexus-hoverboard-real/) then I can.

It's disappointing, but as the linked article says

> But face it, you can break your ankles just fine on a standard park deck.
