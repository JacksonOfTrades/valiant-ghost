I want it.

> This fascinating enclosed world contains marine shrimp, algae and micro-organisms. Made from hand blown glass, each EcoSphere is a completely enclosed, self-sustaining little world. The EcoSphere only needs indirect light and comfortable room temperature (between 60F and 80F.) The EcoSphere works on the basis that a closed system recycles its nutrients and does not produce excess waste. The shrimp conume the algae and micro-organisms and they, in turn, break down the shrimp waste. External light, either artifical or natural, keeps the algae growing. There is no feeding or water changes required. The average life span is between 2 and 3 years. Each EcoSphere comes with a replacement, recharge or upgrade policy.

I really want it.
