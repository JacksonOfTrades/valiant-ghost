I typed [the last post on my phone](/2016/01/a-50mm-experiment/) as my laptop battery had run out only about 5 minutes before. However, instead of the normal keyboard layout I switched the layout (I use SwiftKey) to the thumbs layout, which has a clearly define space in the center of the keyboard, putting half the keyboard to one side like so:

My phone is not a small phone by any means, but it's not massive either. Five inches wide, which is good enough a display for me. 

Maybe this is just me, but I don't like typing in this layout. It makes thumbs start to cramp after a while, and I use my right thumb to type out things on the left side just to stretch them a bit. I'm told I have pianist hands, long and slender which probably doesn't help much. I definitely prefer the old layout. It's got more space and is wider for me to type with. My thumbs no longer feel constrained to one side  of the screen, they can dance  and flow as they wish.
