I was half way through writing a post about an experiment I was doing on my camera when the battery suddenly cut out on me, despite my best attempts to keep the battery life going as long as possible. Windows 10. Again. 

Ever since I've upgraded to Windows 10 the battery on my laptop has been atrocious.  I upgraded the night before my trip to England, August the first. My first inkling was on the flight itself. I opened up my laptop for the first time since I disconnected it from the wall and what do I see? 80% battery left. Odd, considering I have laptop go into hibernate when the button is pressed. When I was in England, I was working on my laptop when what happens? It suddenly cuts out. No warning, no power saver. Just the screen suddenly goes black. I plug it in and turn it back on to find all my PC had essentially restarted. . (I save regularly, so it wasn't an issue.) 

And now, five months later battery is still an issue. I've heard it's an issue for a number of people as well. I hope it gets fixed. Maybe it's just an Asus issue, but it seems like it could be more.
