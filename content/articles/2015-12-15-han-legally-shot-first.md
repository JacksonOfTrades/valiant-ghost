We all know Han shot first, even if it was changed for **reasons**. Well turns out that, if the legal system in the Empire was the same as our worlds, Han would've got off free.

Josh Gilliland, The Legal Geeks:

> There is no question about it.

> And in 1977, no one questioned it.

> However, the legal question remains, was Han Solo legally justified in killing Greedo (Provided the Empireâ€™s Doctrine of Fear had similar Common Law traditions)?

The article goes into much detail about the legal system from here on in.

Turns out Han would've been fine.
