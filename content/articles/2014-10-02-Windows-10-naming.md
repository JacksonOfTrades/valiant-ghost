According to this reddit comment, it's because applications see 'Windows 9' and think it must be either Windows 95 or 98. So Windows 10 is basically a way to avoid that. Of course, this is reddit. And as we all know, anybody can be anyone on the internet. But until any proof is given by Microsoft themselves, this is a probable reason.
