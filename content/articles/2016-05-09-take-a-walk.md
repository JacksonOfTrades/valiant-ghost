Chris Smith: 

> Creative types – especially writers – love a good wander. Charles Dickens and Virginia Woolf were avid city strollers whilst Wallace Stevens wrote his poetry walking to work: “I write best when I can concentrate and I do that best whilst walking,” he said. Modern-day novelists like [Naomi Alderman](http://blog.write-track.co.uk/writers/walk-write-walk-write-naomi-aldermans-writing-life/) go walkabout too – she writes in 200 word bursts sandwiched between regular 15-minute strolls. But is the walking/writing relationship coincidental or can walking have a measurable impact on creative output?

I've been exercising for the first time in my life these last two months, and while I myself havent particularly enjoyed the act of doing it I have noticed that I've been writing a heck of a lot more, my desire to do so has increased and I've had a heck of a lot of ideas, especially when I go for runs.
