A couple of Star Wars fans in Singapore got around to making parts of the Force Awakens trailer... in Singapore. They work parts of the original trailer into it to create this masterpiece, including the <del>Ebon Hawk</del>[^1]flying around the city. It's awesome.

[^1]: I mean the Millennium Falcon! I've been playing a lot of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords lately. It was still fresh in my mind when I wrote this. Both the original and the second ones are very good games, I highly recommend you play them, especially since they're both old and cheap .
