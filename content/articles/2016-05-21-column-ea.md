*Welcome to* The Right Tool For The Job *a column series where I attempt to give a highly objective analysis and review of a weapon from an anime series, eventually leading up to the question of whether I myself would use it. Alucard may be one of the coolest vampires clad all in red, but his two massive handguns are often associated with him as much as his floppy hat and glasses. Akame Ga Kill has a lovely cast of characters, but their Imperial Arm’s are pretty interesting even without the people. Note that each column in this series will likely lead to spoilers about the series. You have been warned.*

To the man who has everything, what do you give? Simple, you give him a tool to destroy the world and hope he doesn't. That, my friends, is the weapon of Gilgamesh in the Fate series, the same Gilgamesh who was in the world's first epic poem: The demigod who ruled over Mesopotamia, and the origin from which all stories came from. As he is the origin of every legend, he also contains every hero of legend's weapons inside the swirly gold portal's he can summon, known as the Gate of Babylon. 

And that is what makes the personal 'sword' of Gilgamesh, Ea, special. Rather than being another one of the infinite weapons inside the Gate of Babylon, where all the weapons in the Fate universe originate, Ea is a weapon wielded only by Gilgamesh. And for good reason.

### A different breed

![Ea](/images/column/ea/ea1.jpg)

Rather than looking like a traditional sword, Ea is shaped more like a lance. The handle and hand guard are similar to a sword, the blade being a conical shape and edge being blunt, with three different sections adorned with cuneiform. When the true power Ea is needed to be used, the different points rotate independent of each other, each rotation generating energy for its true power to be used. 

It's 'true power' is Enuma Elish, named after the Babylonian myth of creation and an Anti-World Noble Phantasm. Yep, Anti-*World*. Arturia's Excalibur is anti-fortress and just look at what that can do. Ea can literally tear the world apart if Gilgamesh so wanted to. In Fate/Extra Enuma Elish is visually depicted as drawing three galaxies togethor before using them to obliterate his opponents.

And due to its power, Gilgamesh will often prefer to fire any of the infinite weapons inside his personal collection. It is a case of *when Ea come out, shit's goin' down.* Referred to as it's own living being by Gilgamesh, he only pulls out Ea on worthy opponents, who to date is only the Kind of Conquerers, Iskandar. When he fought the tentacle monster summoned by Gilles (Caster), he downright refuses to use such a weapon on a filthy creature such as he, nearly forcing Tokiomi to use a command seal in order to slay the beast. Even during his fight with Shirou he did not pull it out until he lacked a single trump card to his name. And even in those final moments, he showed hesitation at using a weapon of such power against one he considered a faker.

Its existence is unique in that unlike all the other weapons owned by Gilgamesh, Ea is the only blade unable to be replicated inside Unlimited Blade Works. Rather than just being a swor... Lan... Drill... Thingy... made by man, its one of the few weapons known as a divine construct, a weapon made by either gods or fairies. However, I believe that given its immense power that Ea is the physical embodiment of [Ea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki), the Babylonian god of creation. Why? Simple. The sword was there during Enuma Elish when the universe was split into a tangible heaven and earth, it has shown the power to rip apart the world if so need and Gilgamesh talks to it like it's a living being, asking it nicely to kill the enemies in his path.

Despite its blunt edge, it can still be used to pierce an enemies chest, which I can only guess is by the pure muscular strength inside Gilgamesh's ripped tattooed abs. Those delectable, stone hard, blocky, dreamy abs. The red, come hither eyes that stare deeply into your soul, portraying either boredom for you or if lust if you're an object of his desire. The golden blond hair, given either a simple bowl cut or a spiky look, accentuating his every feature on his perfect face...

### Would I use it?

Fuck the hell yes. You are not simply wielding a sword, you are wielding a god. ***A GOD. AS A SWORD***. You can't get any more overkill. 

Not only do I love it for the **Over 9000** power level, but as a design nerd, I can't help but love its unorthodox shape of it. Rather than being shaped like a traditional sword, the combination of a lance and a drill smashed together at high speeds to produce a weapon unlike any ever witnessed before makes me love every part of it. Please give it to me.

P.S. Someone made a [working version of Ea](https://twitter.com/GomiHgy/status/721170055740784640), which is pretty cool. The only criticism I can give is that it spins *too* fast, to the point the light inside is simply a blur. Still awesome though.
