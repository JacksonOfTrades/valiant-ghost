Truly, this is a marvelous book. Here's the basic premise: Santa Claus[^1] has gone missing and its up to Death[^2] to do the job of the jolly red man. Meanwhile, an Assassin[^3] is trying to make sure Santa never comes back by invading the Tooth Fairies castle.

Its out there, its insane and delightfully cheerful. And considering its one of the few stand alone Discworld novels you can read this for your first. Read it for this Christmas if you haven't already and re-read it if you have. You won't regret it.

[^1]: Or the Hogfather as hes known in the *Discworld* series

[^2]: Y'know the bloke with the black robe and the scythe and the such

[^3]: The capital '*A*' is important, it makes them distinct from the rest of the common rabble.
