As a guy who's interested in the technical aspects of a film more than the film itself, lens flare has always been one of those things I have always quite liked and payed attention to. But it's also one of those things I've never looked into, despite J.J Abrahams absolute overuse of it. And lo and behold, today I found this video, which opened my eyes to how little I knew about it. From its early life as something to be removed on the cutting room floor, to when the rebel film makers of the 1960's wanted it to make their movies more 'real to today gratuitous overuse of the technique.
