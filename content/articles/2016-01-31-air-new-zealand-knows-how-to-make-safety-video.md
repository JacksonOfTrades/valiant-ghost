Most airlines have a very basic safety video of a friendly crew explaining to you the safety procedures on how to not die on their planes. Not Air New Zealand. They know how to make sure you actually watch the safety video. As I fly on Air New Zealand a fair bit[^1] I've experienced these in all their hilarious glory. 

My favourite, the Men In Black safety trailer. It's got some cool guest  stars, it's well produced and sports a catchy beat[^2].

And of course, wouldn't be New Zealand if they didn't do something Middle Earth related.

Also, a Betty White one. Because why not?
