Back in 2015 OpenType released a standard which made the use of fonts that are more than just one color possible, so instead of just black or blue you can now have black *and* blue. And now the first font to use this new bleeding edge standard has been released: Bixa Color, a new font by [Novotypo](http://www.novotypo.nl/expo/Typewood.html).

OHHHHH! *Shiny multicolored font for the web*. At the time of writing, only Firefox supports the new standard, which means if you view Bixa in any other browser is will simply be your normal monochrome color. On top of web use, it is also designed to be use in wood type.

What you see above is free, but if you want more styles then Bixa is avalible to purchase, with each style costing 20 Euro's each.
