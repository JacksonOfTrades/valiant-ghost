Ah good old [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u), an perpetually growing archive of news and magazine stories I keep telling myself I will *read later* but never get around to, creating an app with over several hundred megabytes of space on my phone that I need to clear every couple of weeks despite the fact I never use the app.
