Chaika Season 2 Episode 10: And that concludes not only Chaika Season 2 but the entire series in general. *And here comes the hollowness of having finished a good anime*. The ending here wasn't necessarily bad it just felt rushed, as I feared it would, but overall it was a good ending. However, the show in general has left me as an awesome one, definitely in my top 10 anime. I'll probably do a longer write-up later.
