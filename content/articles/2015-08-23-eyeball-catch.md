> While out and about in the Sea of Cortez, or the Gulf of California, a few months ago, BBC film crew and whale biologist Mark Carwardine came across something rather unexpected.

>The team was trying to track down a mother humpback and her calf, but instead came across a pod of orcas splashing about at the surface. Since this kind of behavior is typically observed post-kill, the team feared that the orcas may have taken down the humpback calf.

>As the crew approached, they pulled some fleshy remains out of the water, but they were in for a serious surprise. What they recovered turned out to be a giant eyeball. Way too big to have been from the calf.

Lovely, a giant floating eyeball.
