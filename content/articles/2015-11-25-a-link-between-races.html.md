Evan Minto on Anigamers:

> *Zelda* isn’t a game series known for its racial politics, but there’s some surprising — though not necessarily intentional — social commentary to be found in Majora’s Mask. Link's ability to change his race by switching between magical masks, for example, offers some pertinent parallels to real-world race relations.

> Interestingly, Majora’s Mask doesn’t treat this transformation as simple change to your appearance or the mechanics of your character. Your race has social and economic consequences in Termina, which becomes abundantly clear in the opening sequence as you run around Clock Town, stuck in the body of a Deku Scrub.

Honestly, if what's presented in this article is actually true it would not surprise me in the slightest. Majora's Mask is the weirdest *Legend of Zelda* game I've ever known, to top it off the **moon itself** throughout the game has a [huge creepy face](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Moon?file=Moon.png) as it comes to destroy the world.
