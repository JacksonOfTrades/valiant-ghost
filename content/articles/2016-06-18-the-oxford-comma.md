Vox clearly explains the use and origin of the Oxford comma, the most controversial thing in writing. Journalists agree it shouldnt be used, but a heck of a lot of people do. There's even a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/celebrityoxford) about it, asking famous people what they think of the Oxford comma.

For your ever-lovely writer at this here weblog the Oxford comma is one of those tics I just picked up but never stopped using. In my younger years I was homeschooled, but to make sure I was getting a proper education my parents made me do a lot of correspondence courses, one of which was an American English class. In the Australian school system I had been taught to ***never*** have a comma before an *and*, because it was ***wrong***[^1] but in this American class I was told the exact opposite, where the Oxford comma just became ingrained in my writing skill set. And when I went back to an Australian English class, I never could remove the Oxford comma from the assignments I handed in. 

To my knowledge it never hindered me in anyway. So am I for or against the Oxford comma? I use it but really have no obvious preference. Until I can see a rational argument against it I am for it.
