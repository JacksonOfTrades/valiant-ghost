Jake Kastrenakes at The Verge:

> Over the past week, Ashley Madison says it's seen "hundreds of thousands" of new sign ups, including almost 87,600 women. That's surprising for a few reasons, not the least of which being that hackers the other week exposed private information on the site's existing 37 million users, and you'd expect no one to trust the site after that to properly facilitate discreet affairs. There has also been some talk of Ashley Madison misrepresenting its usage and making it seem like far more women use the site than are actually present, something that it's clearly seeking to refute with today's statement.

Of course they'd deny . Whether they're hacked or not, they still want you to use their service.
