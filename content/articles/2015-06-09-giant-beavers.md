> When humans first arrived in North America about 15,000 years ago, the place was full of giant beavers. No, Iâ€™m serious. They were fucking huge, with enormous teeth. 

Its possible this is the North American equivalent of the [Megalina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalania) which Australia used to have. Seriously, they're both freaking terrifying.

P.S. If you get the time, read about [Australian Megafauna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_megafauna). And people say what we have now is bad...
