I read this a lot and I feel it's something that needs to be clarified. The Ghouls in Tokyo Ghoul are **not** committing cannibalism when they feed on a human. They are when they feed on their own species, similar to Kaneki does. But for their average diet of human, they are not.

Cannibalism is defined by [Wikipedia, at least for non-humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism_(zoology)) as eating your own species. When a group of individuals change sufficiently, they have evolved to form a different species, with Ghoul are an evolution of humans . For example, if we ate monkeys it might be *morally* wrong, but it's not cannibalism due to the fact we are an evolution of them, and therefore a different species. 

And Ghouls are definitely evolved humans. While they look like us near perfectly, Ghouls have evolved to only be able to eat humans and drink coffee and water. From eating humans they absorb RC cells, a fictional cell similar similar to amino acids in how we absorb them from our diet. However, Ghouls also have another advantage over our amino acids. Using these RC cells they can form the *kagune *, their 'predatory organ'  which is basically their RC cells formed into a weapon that can be used. Unfortunately we humans can't do this.

So yeah, Ghouls aren't cannibals when they eat us. Each other yes, they are defined as a cannibalistic species because of it, but when they eat us they in fact aren't.
