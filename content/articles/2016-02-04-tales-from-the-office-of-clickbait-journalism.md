Kate Lloyd, writing for Vice:

> I'm sat at a desk in a glossy London publishing house. On the floors around me, writers are working on tough investigations and hard news. I, meanwhile, am updating a feature called "Shocking celebrity nip-slips: boobs on the loose." My computer screen is packed with images of tanned reality star flesh as I write captions in the voice of a strip club announcer: "Snooki's nunga-nungas just popped out to say hello!" I type. "Whoops! Looks like Kim Kardashian forgot to wear a bra today!"


> Back in 2013, I worked for a women's celebrity news website. I stumbled into the industry at a time when online editors were panicking: Their sites were funded by advertisers who demanded that as many people as possible viewed stories. This meant writing things readers loved and shared, but also resorting to shadier tactics. With views dwindling, publications like mine often turned to the gospel of search engine optimisation, also known as SEO, for guidance.

This reminds me of a conversation I had one night with my Aunt about trashy magazines and the people who wrote them. My picture of a person who wrote the kind of articles about Kim Kardashian's love life was of a middle aged woman, with a big grin on her face and a 50's hairdo, blissfully writing about celebrity lives because she thinks people want to know about it.. And coincidentally around the same time I stumbled onto this article, where I learned there is a normal, intelligent person behind the article. Sometimes, they just need to write for a trashy magazine to get the to the top.
