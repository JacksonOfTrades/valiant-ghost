I'm getting hyped for Friday, when I finally watch the new season of Fear the Walking Dead. I can remember when Fear came out, I was a little bored of the Walking Dead, because it just got... kind of the same, just like last season's ending. But Fear, showing the slow breakdown of society in the zombie apocalypse rather than being thrust into it instantly me more than The Walking Dead still did. I reckon that the new season's going to be even better. [And what I've read](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/fear-the-walking-dead-season-two-review/477672/) backs this up.
