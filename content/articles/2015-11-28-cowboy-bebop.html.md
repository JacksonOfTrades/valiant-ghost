It wasn't until towards the very end of Cowboy Bebop that I realised '*Shit, there might actually be something deeper here*'. And there is. Each episode of Cowboy Bebop is cut into little segments 'sessions' that can be mostly watched individually, except for the part 1 and part 2 sections for obvious reasons, and each one tries to tell us something, whether about society or ourselves.

Each sessions is a journey of the bounty hunters aboard the Bebop, trying to make it big in 2071. The crew of four aboard the Bebop is often broke, starved and resenting each other aboard the ship whilst trying to find the next big bounty. The music is stellar, a 1940's jazz theme and the space-western used-future aesthetic is lovely.

This is not a review, but if I did have to review it I would give it five stars. If you want a true review, that explores everything Cowboy Bebop has then read [this review by Hope Chapman on Anime News Network](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cowboy-bebop/bluray-complete-series-amazon-exclusive-edition/.82179). It stellar and far better written than anything I could write myself. Yet. 

Edit: [I wrote a review](/2015/11/cowboy-bebop-its-pretty-good/). Because I was bored and wanted to write.
