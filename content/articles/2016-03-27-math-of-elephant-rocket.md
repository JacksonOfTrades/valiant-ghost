So you may remember a few days ago when I linked to the reddit thread of [The Saturn V fuel consumption in elephants](https://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/4bd03r/saturn_v_fuel_consumption_in_elephants/), I talked about how mathematically innacurate it was[^1]. Well as always my favorite publication *The Atlantic* comes to the rescue:

> The Saturn V’s first stage lasted 180 seconds, so it’s the only stage that appears in this video. According to this NASA news reference, released during the Apollo years and provided to The Atlantic by the space agency’s history office, the Saturn V’s first stage used two different chemicals. The first was RP-1, a form of refined petroleum that is stable at room temperature and served as the rocket’s fuel. The second, liquid oxygen, oxidized the fuel and permitted it to burn. The modern Soyuz launch vehicle, as well as the American Antares and Falcon 9 crafts, still use this combination of liquid oxygen and RP-1.

> So. The first stage consumed 1,400,000 pounds of RP-1 and 3,178,000 pounds of LOX. That’s 4,578,000 pounds of expended chemical in total.

> 4.6 million pounds of elephant. How many creatures is that?

[^1]: Excluding the fact that I'm pretty sure elephants aren't an SI unit of measurement.
