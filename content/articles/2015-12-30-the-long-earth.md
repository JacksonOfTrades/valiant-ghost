This book right here is good, solid Science Fiction, one of my favorite genres. The basic premise is this: in the near future it’s discovered there are alternate worlds, but worlds without people on them. Humans on our earth[^1] can 'step' between these worlds either West or East using a potato powered ‘stepper’. This dawns in a new age for humanity, bringing back the pioneering times of the New World. There is no longer just an earth, but the Long Earth. 

The book is marvelously written, everything feels there for a reason, even if something seems incredibly minor at the time it becomes obvious later. All the characters radiate Pratchett's warmth and life we have come to expect from his writing; from the hardened main character Joshua Valienté, who has been stepping since he was 13, an obviously cold, emotionless drifter along the worlds to Joshua's robotic companion Lobsang, a Tibetan motorcycle repairmen reincarnated as an AI. The setting, alternate worlds, is interestingly done. Each world is completely devoid of life similar to a human, there are animals that are similar and different to ours but that’s about it, while some earths are drastically altered. For example, there’s an earth where the moon was never formed, leading to total messing about in the planets system[^2]

It's not as whimsical and silly as Pratchett's Discworld series, but it’s a bloody good book in its own right, especially for good old science fiction. I've never read anything by Stephen Baxter before, but I'm sure he contributed hugely to this and I'll be sure to lookout for his books in the near future. 

*The Long Earth* is solid and engaging, enough that I read it in only two days. I would thoroughly recommend it.

[^1]: Datum Earth as its called in the novel.

[^2]: If you don't know what would happen if we lost our moon, google it. It's quite incredible what a big rock in the sky does.
