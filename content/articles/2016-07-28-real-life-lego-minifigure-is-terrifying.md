From the Legend Adam Savage's Tested comes the most nightmare fuel possible for today: A Lego minifigure made from *flesh*. The costume for Comic-Con is complete with a rather perfectly proportionate face, two claw like fingers with nails and black, soulless eyes. Imagine if this was from an alternate universe where the Lego Movie where it's not human forms in Lego, but Lego forms in human. Fucking terrifying.
