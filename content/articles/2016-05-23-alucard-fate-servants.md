title: Could a servant from the Fate series kill Alucard?

I've currently got a decent enough headache as I tap this out on my phone into iA Writer. Yes, I know I should be resting it off instead of writing here but I had an... Well it's definitely an idea. 

Alucard in the Hellsing series by Kouta Hirano lives by the dogma of "It takes a man to kill a monster", he refuses to die by anyone be considers less then a man. But simply men like you and I are not enough, no, the slayer of such a beast must weild iron will, and a drive to continue to slay a monster such as he. 

... So, theoretically, if somehow Hellsing and the Fate series were to crossover somehow, then just who would be the most likely candidate?

Let's assume for this that Alucard is not any servant in the Fate series, but rather he is like Gilgamesh, he is simply in a physical form. 

Before we get into this, it's important we understand what Alucard means when he says it takes a man to kill a monster. Alucard has a certain criteria for who is allowed to slay him, as shown by the only two men who Alucard allowed to kill him, Abraham Van Hellsing and Father Alexander Anderson. Physically, the only thing that connects them is a trunk like neck and Bush eyebrows. However, they both possess an iron drive, an infallible goal to slay such a monster and never fail at it. 


I'm sure if Vlad III (Lancer) learned of Alucard's existance he would be first in line to drive his spear through the heart. Alucard represents everything Vlad hates about the legend of Dracula, a blood starved fiend who hungers for the blood of others, marring the legend of Vlad the Impaler. And certainly, his Noble Phantasm, which involves driving up to 20,000 stakes into his enemy would be enough to kill Alucard in any form, even when Control Art Restriction 0 is released.
