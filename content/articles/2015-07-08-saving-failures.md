PC Gamer has collected and composed the most cringey, saddening game save fails of all time. I found this one particularly saddening,

> The Arma 2 DayZ mod in the early days not too long after it had been released as an alpha. I kept a character alive through a brilliantly fought battle that lasted hours. Myself and two friends had managed to kill over 10 fully geared players in an epic shootout, not die, and get all the best and rarest loot you could possibly find in the gameâ€”including one squad's helicopter (this was very early in alpha, so there was only 1 heli spawn per server). Against all odds, and having to fight off subsequent waves of players trying to pick the spoils from the dead, we loaded all the gear we couldn't carry ourselves into the helicopter and were lifting off.

>At that point, the server crashed. When we logged back on, our characters and progress hadn't been saved. The helicopter was gone along with the gear it contained, and all the loot we were carrying from the dead was gone. To salt the wound, our characters had additionally been wiped, so even the gear we had on us before the fight even happened was gone, so we all had to start off from scratch as complete naked noobs.

And, in the spirit of it, and because I feel like writing, I shall tell you my own game tale of crippling saves.

It was Halo Reach, trying for a legendary run. I had got to the mission where you fly a jet, and was Top Gun-ing the hell out of it. After a particularly hard fight, I did a [barrel roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIkJvY96i8w) to celebrate... right into a steel plate. And it auto saved. Leading to me crashing into said metal plate for eternity. I eventually had to restart the entire bloody mission due to just that. Needless to say, I did not a single barrel roll the second time around.
