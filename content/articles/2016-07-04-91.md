I've been listening to the soundtrack of the *original* Hellsing anime recently while I work. The music, shifting between the electric jazz of a dance hall, the depressing piano fit for a smoky bar filled lost souls, a melody of the lone cowboy, and always with an undertone of gothic horror fit for Alucard is *my jam*.
