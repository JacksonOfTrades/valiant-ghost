Its interesting to see how they changed over the years, especially in choice of design. In the earlier examples it was big fonts, a large face on the front, colourful[^1] and hand drawn. Later, the colours got more minimal, darker and were often photoshopped pictures instead of drawings.


[^1]: Horror movie colourful anyway. Mostly muted tones.
