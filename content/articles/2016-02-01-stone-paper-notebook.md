As I first wrote when I [found the inkless metal pen](/2015/04/metal-pen) I take a lot of physical notes and then using it [I found it pretty hard to write anything longer than a simple reminder with it.](/2015/12/using-the-inkless-metal-pen-to-write) But during my trip to [MONA](/2016/01/mona-museum), I managed to pick something up that worked for 13 dollars. A notebook with paper made from stone.

Of course, it’s a special MONA edition. 

As you can probably guess, the paper is made from ground down stone and bonded using calcium carbonate. This produces paper that is incredibly soft and silky to the touch, waterproof, and stronger than your basic tree paper that you usually buy, it’s really hard to pull out a sheet of paper compared to my other notebooks. But more importantly, I can finally write something longer than just a short note without massive strain on my hand using the inkless metal Pen.

Of course, it also works for normal ink and, much to my surprise, keys. The keys write… as well as you’d expect. I used my house keys, and while they writing is legible it’s hard to write with due to the small size of the key and it produced a faint imprint[^1]

I actually can’t find the notebook anywhere on the ‘Net to buy, but [it’s this one here](https://www.logoline.com.au/product.aspx?i=LL9753) with a different MONA themed cover. For some reason you can’t buy it on the website, meaning you’ll just have to make the trip to MONA to get yourself this wonderful notebook. It’s worth it by the way. For the notebook and MONA[^2]

[^1]: Hmmm, sounds familiar to my original complaint of the inkless metal pen.
[^2]: Or you could buy another notebook with stone paper. [They’re pretty popular](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Astone%20paper%20notebook).
