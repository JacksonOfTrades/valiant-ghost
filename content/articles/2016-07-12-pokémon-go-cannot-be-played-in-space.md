When Pokémon Go was first announced I [wondered where you could catch Deoxys](https://valiantghost.com/2016/03/pokemon-go/). Turns out its not the ISS as I originally wondered as Pokémon Go cannot be played in space.

A comment from NASA at *The Verge*: 

> Unfortunately, it is not possible for the astronauts to play. While there is a small number of smartphones available on the space station, the crew uses them for science activities, but not for personal use. The smartphones and other mobile devices on station (tablets) also do not have internet connectivity.
