*Foreword,there's going to be a lot of spoilers about Hellsing Ultimate in this post. If you haven't seen it already I suggest you watch it now.*

In the original Dracula novel by Bram Stoker the only way to put a vampire down for good is to drive a stake through its heart, ending it for good. And this is how the original novel ends, with the inevitable death of Count Dracula at the hands of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. However, such an ending is no fun and Kouta Hirano clearly thought so when he made the Hellsing series, a 'continutation' of the Dracula novel. Here, instead of being staked through the heart by Van Helsing, instead Dracula becomes the loyal servant of Van Helsing and the order he created, the Hellsing Organization. Dracula, now creativly called Alucard,  is the main weapon of Hellsing and for good reason, he cannot be killed. Alucard lives by the dogma of "It takes a man to kill a monster". 

As long as he believes himself to be a monster and his enemies to be nothing more than monsters like him or dogs, he is fundamentally immortal. He refuses to die unless one he considers a man is the person to drive a stake through his heart.

But is Alucard`s opinion of himself valid, or is he merely overestimating his more monstrous qualities, while denying that the true monster may come from outside influence rather than just from him? Then if so, do we go about putting the stake through his heart and making sure he stays that way?

### The Quote

It is first important that we understand what Alucard means when he says ""*It takes a man to kill a monster*", later elaborating that only men can kill monsters because only men try. When he says men he does not mean just any single man, but exceptional men as shown during his trip to Rio De Janeiro, men who transcend normal humanity to become larger than life. The soldiers who attacked him in the hotel were not 'enough' to kill him, so Alucard simply denied their attempt and retaliated.

However, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing from the original novel and Father Alexander Anderson, both humans who Alucard refers to as 'his nemesis', are man enough to kill Alucard. After Anderson transforms into the Monster of God, he gives his humanity up and becomes a monster, gaining all the power the label provides, just like Alucard did back when he was Vlad the Impaler. As Alucard says: "Whether divine or demonic you're still a monster all the same".

The next scene goes on to show this, with almost identical parallels being drawn during the ensuring fight.

Alucard is clearly depressed, thinking himself a coward and regretting his life as a vampire, for his refusal to die honorably as a man back when he was Vlad The Impaler, as clearly shown during Episode 8 before Andersons transformation. He pleads with Anderson to retain his humanity, begging him to not become a monster like him that he may retain the good things that make him human, and not make the same mistake Alucard did. Interesting to note that he is, in fact, holding himself to this dogma so stringently, only a man can kill a monster because only men try. But Helena's Nail powered Anderson certainly tried to kill him,and nearly succeeded too. If not for Alucard's love of Seras then he certainly would have been killed.

And Alucard own paternal love for Seras is considered a 'human' emotion. We love our family and want to protect them. Despite what some people want, the relationship between Alucard and Seras is one of a father and daughter. He wants to discipline her, to have her grow into her new body right, as shown again during the trip to Rio De Janeiro. After Alucard slaughters all the special ops soldiers, Seras gets upset and asks Alucard why he had to do this. Alucard grabs her and screams that if he did not kill the soldiers then the soldiers would've killed both Alucard and Seras, and he did it in the name of self-defence. As soon as Seras starts crying, he softens up and realises that he made Seras sad. 

And yes, Alucard killed every soldier that attacked him in the hotel room simply out of self-defence. Alucard, like a good old cowboy of the West, never shot first. During the incident with the Cheddar Priest, and at the hotel it was not until he was riddled with bullets that he dare launch a retaliation on his attackers. Or did he shoot until *ordered by Integra*? During the hotel scene, he was shot and riddled with holes before he retaliated. And then, despite doing it gleefully, he did not kill any other the other soldiers who attacked him until ordered by Integra. When he blew out the brains of catboy Schrodinger, Integra ordered him to. When he had to go after Rip Van Winkle, it was Integra's order to do so. When he released Control Art Restriction Level 0 in the destroyed London and entered his most powerful and monstrous form, it was the orders of Integra to do so. Alucard even recognizes this is his relationship, as stated in Volume 3 he states that while he will kill the soldier, Integra must still order him to do so.

The line that pops up in the opening every episode of Hellsing Ultimate is: 

> "The Bird of Hermes is my name, eating my wings to keep me tame". 

This quote has two parts:

* The first part of the quote "Here stands the Bird of Hermes" is a direct reference to theRipley Scroll, itself a reference to the Philosophers Stone. The Philosophers Stone was one of the biggest pursuits in alchemy for many centuries, able to turn metals like lead and mercury into silver and gold and granting immortality. The stone is a way to achieve infinite theoretical power, which is why Voldemort wanted it in Harry Potter. Alucard being the 'Bird of Hermes' is calling himself the Philosophers stone, he has managed to reach immortality. 



* The second part "eating my own wings to keep myself tame" ties back the original Bird of Hermes quote. A lot of birds must eat their wings in order to trim them so that they can have control over their flight. When Alucard as the Bird of Hermes 'eats his wings' he is controlling the theoretically unlimited power he has as the Philosophers Stone, in order to keep any kind of control the Integra and the Hellsing Organization has over him.[^6] 

It's not necessarily Aluard keeping control over himself, but rather the Hellsing Organization keeping control over Alucard and his power, so as to make sure the events of the novel Dracula never happen again. 

The Control Art Restrictions are also another way for Integra to have full control over Alucard. Alucard, by an incantation, can release Control Art Restriction Level3-1, but to get to his full potential, Control Art Restriction 0 Integra must verbally order him to be able to. Alucard still remains incredibly powerful even without enabling any of the Control Art Restrictions[^4], but even the very presence of them implies controlling master/servant relationship between the two of them, with Alucard having little way to defy Integra no matter what he wants.  Luke Valentine even intones this during his final moments, stating that Alucard is nothing but the "…Hellsing family toy! A dog for the Church of England not even fit to call himself a Vampire!"

After Alucard kills Anderson as the Monster of God, he begins crying, saying that both he and Anderson were one and the same, and this is how Alucard became what he is. While Alucard doesn't go into detail on this, it's obvious that he is referring to the reasons they became monsters. Both in their final moments gave into a greater power in order to fight the threat opposing them, Alucard had the Turks and Anderson had Alucard, but in doing so they surrendered their humanity and become nothing more than monsters. 

And Anderson, somehow restored to his humanity in his final moments by having the source of his evil ripped out of him, tells Alucard not to cry. Because only humans cry, and when they can cry no more then they become monsters. Assuming we take this in the metaphorical sense it could mean that people only cry when they can keep going on, have some drive and desire to keep living. Both Alucard and Anderson became monsters because their mortal bodies gave out on them, but they could not die yet, not while an enemy who must be slain stood before them. And thus, in order to continue on they surrendered their humanity to become monsters and gain all the power that comes with it. Of course if we take this in the literal sense then Alucard's cryingis a sign that over the course of the 500 years he has been a vampire he still has some humanity left … which we could use to kill him. 

To further add to the idea that Alucard has some humanity left count how he was 'killed' by catboy Schrodinger, named after the paradoxical both dead and alive cat. Schrodinger, with his ability to manipulate spacetime and be everywhere and nowhere does not even begin to classify as a man, especially by Alucard's, especially high criteria.  But in his final moments, Alucard embraced his human side, casting down the dogma he holds himself to so stringently for so long without him even knowing… which Walter even intones with his speech "There is no such thing as a true immortal. You might've been on to something, so let's put it to the test." And thus, Schrodinger was able to kill Alucard.

So, if Alucard truly has a human side then we should be able to kill him any way possible even if Alucard defies it. All we have to do is kill him 3,424,867 times.

Or, as I'm sure the Major would agree, maybe it's Alucard's lack of autonomy that renders him his monster status. By simply being ordered around by Integra to do whatever she wishes could, in fact, render him his lack of humanity, being nothing more thana puppet for Integra's orders. The Major describes not his own biological mortality as what makes a human a human[^5] but rather his own will to keep driving himself on his own, without the aid of any other sustenance like souls or blood as Alucard needs, he is his own master. 

But if the incredibly long writing above is wrong and he is a monster then what do we do? Then we need to get a man to kill him. 

Both Anderson and Van Helsing have a common trait. Sure they are both big and broad, with a trunklike necks and big bushy eyebrows. But they both possess a will, an iron drive in order to keep moving forward, and are willing to fight Dracula no matter what.Anderson had his regeneration abilities, but he also had faith in god and the will to fight Alucard despite the obvious risk to him. So if we have a baseline for our candidates to fight Alucard, then we can begin to devise a plan to kill him. We need simply, the iron will to fight monsters.

Assuming Alucard is not sexist and he didn't just choose Anderson and Van Helsing because they were male, then it's likely we  could probably use Integra for this only. As the only living blood descendant of the man who took Alucard down when he was the Count, it's likely that she could. Although this scenario to work, we must count the fact that Integra is the monster and Alucard is a man, otherwise if they are both monsters Alucard's dogma will not allow this to happen. Walter forfeited the right when he became a vampire by the Nazi's, and Anderson did so when he drove Helena's Nail into his heart.Seras is a monster just like him, and there are few other important characters to name, meaning that we're slowly running out of characters. 

And thus, we must finally derive our own conclusions on what must be delivered in order to make sure Alucard stays down for good. Assuming that he is in fact human, then all we have to do is simply cut through all the souls Alucard has absorbed in his life to finally put the monster down for good. However if he is indeed a monster as he claims then we better start putting up the job notices in order to put this monster down for good. 

[^1]: Or as Alucard says, there is no such thing as a true immortal.

 

[^2]: With Integra being called a badass because of it.

 

[^3]: Until he finally disobeys her orders

 

[^4]: The original anime seems to suggest that Alucard often operates at a 'low' control art restriction of about 3 to fight ghouls and basic vampires, but I am not counting that in this essay.

 

[^5]: As he is, in fact, a machine



[^6]: It's also important to note that Hermes was a god that tricked the other gods for humans benefit, symbolic of Alucard's role as the vampire that fights other vampires for humanities benefit.
