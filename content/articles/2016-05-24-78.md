![My current Fate/Grand Order Party](/images/fgoparty/2016-05-24.jpg)

It's been a while since I last gave some news on my Fate/Grand Order team, so I thought I'd give you all an update. I got Attila/Altera to her 3rd Ascension, where she gains a pair of badass wings. I've replaced EMIYA with EMIYA (Archer to Assassin) and perhaps the biggest addition, CÃº Chulainn (Alter) as a Berserker, who I managed to get today. As of now he's currently the weakest of the bunch - only level 30 - but he takes the role of "*If I'm going down you're going down with me*". Combined with Kaleidoscope, his Craft Essence, he can engage his Noble Phantasm quickly and destroy... pretty much everything. I'm not sure what his Noble Phantasm even is, but I love it. A buff *before* he rips into the enemy. Love it.
