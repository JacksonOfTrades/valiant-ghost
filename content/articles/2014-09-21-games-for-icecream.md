How 'bout no? Here in Australia anyway, this would mean I am giving 120 dollars away. And it's and its one ice cream per person, not per game. So that would mean I am losing about 98.6% of what I payed. And they're also doing it for toy guns.

Why are they doing it? Well, the cynic in me says because they want to mitigate blame for their bad parenting to Video Games, similar to what they did in the 50's with comic books, but they say it's because children mimic what they see.

Now that's true, but if you actually teach your kids whats right and whats wrong, they won't turn into a psychopath by playing Call of Duty. Hell, I grew up playing Halo and I turned out fine.

I think.
