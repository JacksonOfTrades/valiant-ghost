Here's a lovely old Marco.org post I found.

Marco Arment:

> <p>I don&#8217;t know why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Panda">pandas</a> are always the representatives for movements to save endangered species.</p>

> <p>Pandas absolutely suck at living.</p>

This was... definetly not what I expected to find when going through the Marco.org archives.
