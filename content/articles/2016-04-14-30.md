I've been sick all today, and that's left me with little to do other than watch videos on YouTube and play Fate/Grand Order. Should I be resting? Probably but there's a special event on so... Plus I've just gotten back into it after about two months. I've made a solid party and wanted to share it here for a while, and as I'm sick I thought why not?

They are from left to right: Atilla the Hunn, Jekyll, Bonny and Read, Helena Blavatsky, and EMIYA. The only reason I keep Jekyll around is because my only other option is <del>Browulf</del> Beowulf. And I don't like him.
