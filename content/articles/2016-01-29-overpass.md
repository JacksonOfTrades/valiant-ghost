A new-ish open source font created by [Delve Fonts](http://www.delvefonts.com/) and commisioned by the [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/) for their brand. It's a friendly looking sans serif font based on [Highway Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_Gothic), the type face used on a road signs throughout the world, for web use. It comes in four sizes, extra-light, light, regular and bold. Due to it being based on Highway Gothic, a font used on roads because of its readability at any distance, this font should in theory work on any screen resolution perfectly.

I tried to use it on the this site to see how it is, and from my experience it works best for headings rather than the body text.
