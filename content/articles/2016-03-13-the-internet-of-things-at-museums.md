Today while I was cleaning I listened to [episode 112](http://thewebahead.net/112) of the [Web Ahead](http://thewebahead.net/), a podcast on the changing technologies of the web and to which I am a semi regular listener. In this episode host Jen Simmons and guest Stephanie Rieger talk about the Internet of Things[^1] and how things like Smart `{device name}` require their own separate app to control them and how this presents a major problem. For example, if your going to a hotel which you're only staying at for a few days and the lamp can only be controlled by an app, instead of the more common lightswitch. This presents a major hassle to you, especially if for some reason you can't get the lamp app or your phone. Or even worse, if the Internet cuts out, no more lights for [^2]. 

MONA museum actually provides a very good fix to this problem. I briefly touched on this when I [wrote about them earlier this year](/2016/01/mona-museum/). When you first get to the museum you are given an iPhone with some kind of custom app force loaded unto it. As you walk around your phone detect beacons - Jen talks about these a lot in this episode - and if you select it you can be given information on the art. Not what you expect in a hotel, but it's a good example of how the public web/IoT could become a common thing in the world.

While this may seem like a bit of a stretch, comparing a museum to a hotel, but if a hotel can afford Smart Devices and IoT products well... They can probably afford a few old iPhone's.

[^1]: Big I, little O, big T. IoT. I have no real clue as to why the o is small. Stop the o discrimination!

[^2]: Jen actually puts forth a really good design idea for smart devices, design them like escleators instead of elevators. Because at least if the power goes out with an escalator at least you have a set of stairs, instead of a locked box.
