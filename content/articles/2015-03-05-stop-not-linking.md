> The most ethically and professionally sound practice when you have little value to add to the source story is the linked-list approach. Give a teaser quote and a prominent link. Make it clear that you didn’t write the target article, there’s more to be read there, and here’s how to get to it.

This is pretty much the motto for how I write this site. And yes, I do realise I just did what the quote says. I can assure you it was entirely unnintentional.
