Foreword: This is apart of The Coffee log, but I felt that it was good enough to be an actual post on this site. So I present to you, the third Coffee Log entry, *Gonzo:*

I often wonder if I could make money off of Valiant Ghost. I've put time and effort into it, but I think the thing holding me back is the lack of original content. I don't write any, or hardly any worth reading. I think when I manage to plug my laptop, I'll [write something about coffee](http://www.valiantghost.com/2015/07/coffee-log-2) on it. But do I even want to publish it? I've always tried to keep a professional dislocation with Valiant Ghost. I always tried to keep my opinion out of the things I like here.

But lately I haven't been doing that. Rather than just regurgitating the shit I found of tech sites (Mashable, The Verge .etc) I've been just linking more of the cool things I found on the internet, which I think is cool.

My Writings changed too. I will admit with no denial that Valiant Ghost is heavily inspired by [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/), [Marco.org](http://www.marco.org/), [Kottke.org](http://kottke.org/) and [the candler blog](http://www.candlerblog.com/). The linked stuff was cool, but the writing was better. Bloody good. Comparing Valiant Ghost to those was like comparing common journalism to [Gonzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism). And I fucking love Gonzo.

I kept a professional dislocation from my site, they didn't. They were modern Gonzo at its finest. John Gruber comes to mind the most of all when I think of Modern Gonzo. He loves Apple. He loves everything about it with such an intense passion, that's why he started Daring Fireball.

Here's the reference to that, its about 2 and a half minutes in.

Anything concerning Apple, he will write about it. Anything that shames Android or Windows, he will write about it[^1] . Marco Arment likes coffee and he will sometimes write about it[^2].

Sometimes in the last few months, I realised "You can put all the effort into the code of Valiant Ghost, give it a better hosting option, push it up the Google search rankings and give it a mobile responsive theme. But if you keep up this stupid dislocation, put up Mashable link after Mashable link then that's not going to mean nothing, and Valiant Ghost will be a cold air balloon"[^3]

So if you are going to start blogging, throw some passion and some life into it, don't do what I did and keep a dislocation from your blog. If you're lazy (like me) I recommend taking the linklogging approach to blogging. I wrote the [code for a Middleman Linklog](http://www.valiantghost.com/2015/06/middleman-linklog), and Jonothan Poritsky wrote [the code for getting it working in Octopress](http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/30/octopress-linked-list/). Marco Arment put up a [good argument on why you should linklog](http://www.marco.org/2012/07/03/stop-not-linking).

I think I keep doing Valiant Ghost because I found my niche here. I like to write, but not too much. As mentioned above, I'm lazy. Far too lazy to ever commit to writing a novel. That's why I do Valiant Ghost. I can write longer posts (like this) here, but I'm not required to and can just link cool things I find. A novel is just such a creative steep hill in terms of effort that it seems to hard.

So yeah, I'll do my writing here thank you very much. And with any luck, It'll be better than the crap I started with.

[^1]: This isn't slamming Gruber. Not at all. Its Gonzo and his site. He can say whatever the fuck he wants. 

[^2]: So do I. It's a caffeine high that inspired this writing.

[^3]: In the words of comedian [Mitch Hedberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg): 'Hop in my cold air balloon. We ain't going fucking nowhere.'
