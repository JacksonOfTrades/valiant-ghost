As some of you may know on the night of the 29th May Heroku broke for me, disconnecting my website from Dropbox which I deploy this website with. And then for some reason Middleman also broke on my machine, meaning I could not redeploy it to Heroku. After two days of messing around, which involved upgrading Middleman to V4, I managed to work out a fix and get this website back on the web. In the process this broke a few things, including the RSS feed's and the dates of a microblog post being how you linked to it. I'm working on a fix right now, but until then expect VG to be a *little* broken.
