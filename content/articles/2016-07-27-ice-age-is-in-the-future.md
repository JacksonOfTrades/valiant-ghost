Todd Van Der Werff, writing for Vox about the new Ice Age movie and how it is apparently set in the future:

> Look back at that timeline for the meteor. It arrives every 100 million years, thanks to deposits of various magnetic metals in the Earth’s surface that also apparently keep very rigid timetables. And yet the last one bumped off the dinosaurs, which happened just 65 million years before our present day, give or take. Also, Buck discovers the meteor exists thanks to ancient tablets, which record a prophecy of its arrival and are found in a suspiciously human-looking underground temple.

> So does *Ice Age: Collision Course* take place 35 million years in the future, perhaps suggesting we are doomed to live out endless cycles of mammalian death and rebirth, until we finally get things right?

> I don’t know — but it would explain why they know all our pop songs, that’s for sure.

This would explain a lot, including how Manny knows what a waffle is.
