![The Rum Diary by Hunter  S. Thompson, also known as one of my favorite books](/images/favbook.jpg){: .vertical }

I'm currently on my third reading of a book I love so very much, *The Rum Diary* by Hunter S. Thompson. I haven't actually read a lot of Hunter, other then a few of his articles and the very beginning of *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*, but I can't help but love this book. It's a fast paced, under loved gem of a novel and why haven't you read it already?

★★★★★★ (That's six out of five btw)
