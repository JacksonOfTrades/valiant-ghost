Napier Lopez, *The Next Web*:

> Smartphones still have a long way to go before they can match up to current mirrorless and DSLR offerings with larger sensors, but it’s important to acknowledge that smartphone cameras are already really good.


> The combination of hardware advancements in small sensors and smart software processing like fast auto HDR has made smartphone photography more viable for a multitude of conditions, especially for viewing on digital screens.


> But there will be diminishing returns on sensor improvements, particularly considering that many people with a current generation smartphone already consider their smartphones ‘good enough’ – just look at [Flickr’s camera stats](https://www.flickr.com/cameras).


> In other words, slightly better resolution or low light performance from a small sensor won’t make a huge difference, and manufacturers need to do more to differentiate their photography chops.

I have a nice DSLR with some good lenses, but the matter of the fact is that my phone is always on me no matter where I am, while my DSLR is often too chunky to carry around all day every day. I would say that maybe instead we could [design specialized smartphones with better cameras in them](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/how-smartphones-will-become-unboring/475503/) but really, with a better smartphone camera everybody wins. Parents can take better photos of their kids and I don't have to apply Gaussian blur in photoshop to make sure you focus on the subject.
