Google recently announced some stuff for the [new Android N preview](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2016/04/android-n-developer-preview-2-out-today.html), but the biggest one to me is that the emoji will be changed from the sexless, raceless, [lego-like](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Minifigure) blobs that I love to actual *people*[^1]. And while [some people](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11423722/android-is-finally-getting-better-emoji) like that they're going to be humans, I wish they just kept their emoji how they were. Because I really like their cute, cartoony blobishness. They remind me of [Bloo](http://fhif.wikia.com/wiki/Bloo) from Fosters Home For Imaginary Friends, one of my favorite cartoons of my childhood.
