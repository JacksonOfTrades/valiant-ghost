Adrienne LaFrance tried some services to send a telegram to her editor in 2016. She failed.

> I grew up in an era when cassette tapes, fax machines, and long-distance telephone calls gave way to CDs, emails, and cellphones—only to be supplanted by MP3s, chat platforms, and smartphones. I still write letters. I will neither confirm nor deny having gone through a vinyl phase.

> But telegrams! I could have sent one. And I didn’t seek them out until it was too late. Western Union closed its telegraphy service a decade ago. (“The last 10 telegrams included birthday wishes, condolences on the death of a loved one, notification of an emergency, and several people trying to be the last to send a telegram,” the *Associated Press* [reported](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11147506/ns/business-us_business/t/stop-telegram-era-over-western-union-says/#.VqDq8GTF8ik) of the closure in 2006.) These days, it’s nearly impossible—it may actually *be* impossible—to send one in the United States, even if you try.
