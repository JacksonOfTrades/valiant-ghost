Breaking Bad Season 1: I did something new last night, I binge watched an entire season. The first season of Breaking Bad after my friend and occasional editor here kept bugging me to watch it. And so I did. Breaking Bad was a little different from the shows I usually watch[^1] but it was brilliant. The music was obviously the best thing to take away, it was masterfully used in every aspect, and the opening music is brilliant. The two main characters, Walter White and Jessie Pinkman, had a dynamic and funny relationship, although I didn't really like Jessie at first I warmed up to him at the end. Plus I liked subtle little things, like how the opening of an episode would often mislead you entirely in an different direction as to what would actually happen. I realise I'm writing this microreview about eight years too late for a lot of people to actually care, but if you yourself haven't seen it I would totally recommend you watch it. 

[^1]: Although the only non-anime show I do watch is The Walking Dead
