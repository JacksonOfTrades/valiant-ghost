Justine Alford writing for I Fucking Love Science:

> A child from Uttar Pradesh, India, was born with three penises and no anus. While that may sound suspiciously like a tabloid headline that has emerged from a stretched truth and Chinese whispers, doctors who operated on the two-year-old child in Sion Hospital have spoken to the media about his condition.

Lovely. Worse is this cringe inducing sentence:

> Finally, they forged a penis from the two more-developed penises by fusing them together.

Gah!
