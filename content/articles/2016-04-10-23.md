Chaika Season 2 Ep 2: Mostly a fight episode, but theres some background lore exposed and there's the Red tsundere Chaika again. I also believe that this is an episode where we can begin to analyse an underlying theme in this series: What does it mean to be human? Are you real just be living? Metaphysical stuff that people like me with anime-related weblogs love.
