Urvija Banerj, writing for Atlas Obscura: 

> Imagine that you are a pregnant lady. (Perhaps you actually are, but if you are not, then do your best to imagine.) You are in your third trimester, and you get on a plane because you weren't paying attention during your last doctor's visit, where she advised you against traveling. Somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean, your water breaks.


> In some miracle there is a gynecologist on board, a few aisles down from you, and therefore your labor goes as smoothly as it could possibly go in those circumstances. And then, while you are still over the Atlantic Ocean, your baby is born. You arrive at United States customs, clutching your newborn baby, who obviously does not have a passport. Where do you say your baby is from?


> The answer is quite complicated, and contested. Countries have different laws governing the citizenship of babies born on their soil–either *jus soli *or *jus sanguinis*; Latin for right of the soil versus right of blood, respectively. Most countries follow *jus sanguinis*, which dictates that the baby can only assume citizenship via one or both parents. However, the U.S. and some of its neighbors observe the more generous *jus soli*, which grants automatic citizenship to babies born on their soil.
