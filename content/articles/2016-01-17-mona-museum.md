The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) is a weird, wacky and wonderful place located on the Berriedale peninsula of Tasmania and owned by millionaire David Walsh. As you can probably guess, I went there. And it's not like any museum I've ever been in before. Usually in a writing thing like this, you'd expect photography to accompany it[^1] but as clearly stated in the visitors guide:

> "No videos of photography may be reproduced, distributed, sold or displayed on a personal website without our permission." 

So no photography will be here, unfortunately. So I won't be writing some reporters event coverage, considering it’s a museum and it’s pretty much open throughout the entire year. But I felt like writing about it, as it's an odd experience I think everyone should see for themselves.

### It's Really Weird, and different in a good way.

First of all, this museum is REALLY weird. And NSFW in a lot of places. Don't embrace that nudity can be art? You probably won't like MONA. It also breaks away from the traditional style of a museum. When you first enter MONA, which is underground after a really long winding staircase, you are given an iPhone[^2] with a custom app loaded on it and which you cannot leave[^3]. There is no plaques on the side of the art to tell you what it is, the phone is your guide, and it electronically searches out for any art around you and gives you info on it. Initially this annoyed me, but I grew to like it. Each description of the artwork[^4] is usually much longer and more varied than just a simple museum description, due to the extra space the digital device allows you. It also allows for the owners of the museum to write about what they think of the art in a Gonzo section. At first I skipped these sections, as they are often really long, but then I went back to them and read them. They're well written, clearly by people who are much better writers and who understand art better than I.

The museum itself is labyrinthine. You have to walk down a spiral staircase, to below ground first to enter the museum. As you enter the first thing you hear is very ominous music being played. The entire museum is dark and creepy, perfectly complimenting the art itself. The odd burst of light was a welcome sight, but you'd always have to end up walking back into the darkness.

### The Art(wank)

Remember when I said it's weird? It really is. There's a working digestive system that breaks down food using an InSinkErator™ and puts it through a number of chemicals to output... shit. And it smelled like it too. I personally gagged when I went in there, and a number of people covered their mouths and quickly walked out after experiencing the result of the food being broken down. I loved it. Not only because of the science and technology nerd in me that allowed it to be created, but in the fact someone had though to create that and put it in a museum.

Next, there was a kind of roofed maze with binary along the walls. According to the guide, it was excerpts of the Epic of Gilgamesh. And in the center of the maze was a mirror on the roof, which freaked the shit out of me and another guy when we first entered it. It almost looked like there was something about to fall on us. 

There was a room I came upon which at first just looked like 30 televisions playing people of varying genders dancing. Well to my surprise they suddenly burst out into Madonna. In perfect acapella. I was shocked at first. Then it was funny. Upon consulting the guide, it lasted for an entire album and was meant to symbolise idolatry in its finest form, as all the singers were Madonna fans. There was a charming variety of the singers there; man who looked bored out of his mind, a man in drag, a man dressed as a cowboy. It was gloriously funny although I left pretty quickly. I've never liked Madonna myself, but I did recognize the important value she had on music culture. Still, not even that was enough to have me sit through an entire album of her music.

And then there was my personal hell. It wasn't demons flaying me with whips with fire burning around me or anything like that. No. It was books upon books. Plenty of books. Enough to keep me occupied for a long while. And they were all blank. The entire room was sterile white, the books were blank, the pages on the table were blank. I asked, and the books were blank. This, people, is how you would torture me. Stick me in a room full of my favorite thing, books, and then have them revealed to be all blank. 

To really experience MONA, you have to be there yourself. I can write for length about the weirdness of it, but I'll cut it short here. Its a NSFW museum, if that makes any sense. Don't bring the kids. There are dick's, vagina's and boobs everywhere. But it's glorious in its own weirdness. I'd definitely recommend you go there for yourself. 

And now to end with an old cliché: 

>  "It's not for everyone, but should be experienced by everyone."
