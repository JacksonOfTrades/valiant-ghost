You might remember around the middle of the year I posted about [the inkless metal pen by Vat19](https://www.vat19.com/item/the-inkless-metal-pen) and how I was hyped to get it. Well after around 7 month’s here’s my thoughts on using it.

If you're considering buying it for writing, then know it’s a bit harder than just writing with a pen or pencil. A certain amount of extra force needs to be applied when writing with it, which applies some extra strain to your hand over long writing periods. Also, don't use it for class notes. The pen doesn't work well on the thin surface classroom notepad paper often is, and the notes are damn near unreadable due to how light it leaves a mark. However, it writes fine on standard printer paper and notepad paper and damn near every other surface, including glossy magazine paper. According to the website, it can also write upside down and underwater, if you some reason you ever needed to do that.

When it comes to drawing I'm not artist, but the pen does adequately. I found it easier to draw with an ink pen, but as I said I'm not artist, so the easier option was better for me. Granted, one of its main selling point is to 'doodlers' so if you draw then it may be a good buy. The experience was smooth enough to warrant maybe using it for basic sketches.

Aesthetically, the pen itself is rather nice. I bought the black version and while the paint has word down a little bit from where I dropped it once it still looks nice, and so does the metal tip. The flat bit at the other end of the tip can also be used as a basic stylus. I'm not lying, it works on my Sony phone and my laptop touchpad. The plain metal barrel, with a consistent diameter all the way is comfortable to hold in your hand, and the aluminum barrel has a nice feel to it.

Overall, would I recommend this? Maybe. If you're buying this because you're sick of buying ink for your pen to take class notes in, I wouldn't recommend it. The added friction and strain on your hand isn't worth the money you'll save not buying ink. However, if you are thinking of buying it for art or just general note taking purposes (Like: Call Becky, pool) then it’s a decent thing to buy. It's also a unique little gift to get someone for the holidays.
