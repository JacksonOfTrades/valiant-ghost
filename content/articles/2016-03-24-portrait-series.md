Canon set up an experiment which involved six photographers being told six different stories about the same man and being told to shoot a portrait of him. As they were told different stories about him, from a millionaire, a lifesaver, an ex-con, a fisherman, a psychic, a recovering alcoholic, each photographer gave him a different portrait.

As a photography nerd, I have to say the amount of detail that the camera and lens provides is superb. But as a film nerd[^1] I have to say that the actor pulled off his multiple roles flawlessly, you can see during some of his scenes when he plays an ex-inmate he's clearly a lot harder and more paranoid then his other forms, as a millionaire he's a bit more cocky.

[^1]: I don't watch a lot of movies, but when I do I am often more interested in the story *behind* them film/lens, the director, the props, the cinematographer. All the technical aspects.
