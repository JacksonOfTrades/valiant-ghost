*Coffee:* 

> At what point do you admit you've had one too many? I'm not talking about alcohol, I'm talking about coffee. I've had five in twelve hours. I'm currently wanting to run down the cabin of the plane screaming at the top of my lungs the lyrics to the song I'm currently listening to. But considering I know that would probably get me arrested, I decided against it. 

> I realise I'm jittery. Really jittery. Five coffees in twelve hours tends to leave you with a lot of built up energy you cant otherwise exert when on a plane. That's why I'm writing this. My mind and bladder are extremely full of caffeine. A recent trip to the bathroom confirmed I had bloodshot eyes. High on Caffeine. The d√©but album by Jackson Wyndow.

Now, I know what you're thinking. *"Jackson, how and why in gods name did you drink five coffees in twelve hours?"* Well reader, I hadn't intended it. I had two in the morning, one at home and one in the terminal. When I got on the plane, I ordered a coffee. When that didn't come for a while, I ordered another one. Still nothing, third times the charm, ordered a third one. They all came at roughly the same time by different stewardesses. After the first one, they seemed rather confused at how many coffees I was drinking.

But still, coffee is coffee. And no way in hell would I let it go to waste.
