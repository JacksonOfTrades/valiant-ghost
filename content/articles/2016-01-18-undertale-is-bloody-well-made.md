Evan Minto, Anigamers:

> I'm in the middle of my second playthrough of Toby Fox's Undertale, the bizarre indie RPG that stole the Internet's collective heart last fall. While I've had some issues with the combat mechanics in the game, what consistently blows me away is Toby's insane attention to detail; the game reacts to even the most minute player actions. This effectively removes the sense of security and anonymity that games give players who understand game design conventions.

I've never played Undertale, but I've heard of it before, mostly through [@UndertaleTweets](https://twitter.com/undertaletweets). The attention to detail seems absurd, making Undertale not your ordinary game, as Evan later goes into detail about in the article. Wearing some cool armor? *The game knows*.
