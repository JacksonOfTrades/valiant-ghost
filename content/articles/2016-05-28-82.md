Finally got around to watching *The Revenant*, the movie that finally killed all the "Leo never won an Oscar" meme's. It's a solid movie, all throughout my family wouldn't shut up about the cinematography, which is honestly amazing. Every character plays the role well, and while the story was initially a little (Ed: A lot) confusing, I grew to like it.
