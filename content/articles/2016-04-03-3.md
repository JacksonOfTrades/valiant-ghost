And now for my first Microreview, of Chaika. Overall the first episode left me with strong first impressions, the main character who the show is named after, Chaika Trabant is funny and adorable and talks a little bit. like this. In half-sentences. The music, style and animation are all superb. The story leads me wanting for more, who is Chaika and why is she carrying a massive coffin on her back? Can't wait for the next episode.
