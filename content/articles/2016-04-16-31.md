Just solved a day long coding problem in the backend of this site. The problem: My phone decided to sync two posts I'd written a few days ago during wonky internet with incomplete file names and front matter, and Middleman did not like it at all. Anyway, now that it's fixed there should be nothing stopping me from doing some more Microreview posts and finishing Chaika!
