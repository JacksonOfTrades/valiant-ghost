> Hey Jim, was Steve always bisected at the waist with a causterised wound, or is this a new thing? Oh, I see you're doing it too now. 

I've gotten into Warframe now, and this is something rather frequently if you play melee stealth like I do. They can walk right past the body of their friend, dead and cut in two at the waist like it's completely normal.

On a sidenote, I recently got the [Valkyr](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Valkyr) frame and it's fun to play with, the first ability is a kind of laser wire which you can use to transport *and* cut people in half. The perfect weapon. Coupled with my perchant for stealth and firesword with a fire mod on it, therefore making double fire, there's probably lots of dead people having cauterised wounds wherever my Warframe goes.
