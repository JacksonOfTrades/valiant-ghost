My anime list did a... list on why people watch anime as opposed to lists *about* anime. And I've gotta say, it seems pretty accurate. I consume and love anime for reasons often said here. It looks goofy but can feel very mature, the art style is awesome in both its similarities across shows and yet the difference each different show provides. Anime is unlike anything produced in the West I've ever seen before.

Although I think point 4 ran very true for me:

> *"We connect ourselves to the characters and become incredibly invested. For example, I can't think of one person that calls Marge Simpson their waifu..."* - Michele Sontag

> Michele's point is simple: what other medium, aside from video games, is as intense with its fan-fiction, cosplays, fanart, and connection to characters? Not too many, especially if we love that character enough to spend months creating a dress or pants while going to work or school.

> There are many characters that, for one reason or another, grab our hearts to the point where we care about them. Whether it's some goofy, spiky haired kid from Dragon Ball with only a pole and a 4 star ball left by his dead grandpa, or a young girl from Sora Naegino with enough passion to fly to the United States from Japan to fulfill her childhood dream, sometimes we get attached to them -- and they influence us in ways most mediums can't do.

I love the Hellsing anime. Not because its actually a good show[^1], but because Alucard is awesome and his antihero qualities make him more endearing than most people in the show. Cowboy Bebop is not about the ship, or saving the galaxy from an intergalactic threat, but simply about four bounty hunters and a dog trudging through space in order to eat. Anime crafts the interesting, unique characters that is often hard to find anywhere else, and for that reason I love it.

[^1]: It's undeniably badass, over the top and ultraviolent, but I feel it often falls short on story.
