I bought my first Moleskin notebook today, the [Cahier](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/8883704924/thebooklab-20) style after I read [this BoingBoing article](http://boingboing.net/2016/07/01/im-a-fanatic-for-moleskine-c.html) on them. It's in black[^1] and with grid pages. 

After I wrote the obligatory "Hey this is my first notebook" blurb in it, I proceeded to write out a daily schedule. I'm liking the notebooks so far, fits in my jackets inside pocket like a charm and the pages feel nice to write on. Plus at only 16 dollars for a pack of three their overall value is little above the sentimental.

When I went to England last year I kept a notebook with me at all times, but I lost it when I flew back to Australia on the plane[^2]. As its been almost a year, the new notebook fits perfectly back into my life.

[^1]: I've been wearing almost all black lately for some reason I can't explain. The notebooks go nicely with it.

[^2]: I suspect it probably fell out of my pocket sometime on the connecting flight from Singapore, as by that point I had been awake for 60 hours.
