OMG YUS YUS YUS!!!!!!!

...Okay Jackson restrain yourself. Seriously though, I'm so excited about this. Both series if done right could work really well on mobile. Animal Crossing's friendly atmosphere would be wonderful on your phone, especially with a social network characteristic to it, but I'm not sure how they'd deal with [this guy](http://animalcrossing.wikia.com/wiki/Resetti). 

Fire Emblem could also work well, not for long drawn out battles but lots of little quick ones you can knock out on a bus ride. Longer battles could work of course, with an autosave to account for the other things your phone has to do. 

Like actually being used to take calls.
