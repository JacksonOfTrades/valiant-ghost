In this SNL skit Kylo Ren goes undercover to try and learn what its like being a normal worker on Starkiller Base[^1]. I can't be the only one who would seriously watch a series dedicated to sending fictional characters from movies, video games, anime and comics and such to see what it's like to be a normal person in the world. It would be great. Imagine what it'd be like for Integra Hellsing (Helling/Helling Ultimate) to see what its like to be a  normal soldier for the Hellsing Organization, or Lord Death (Soul Eater) learning how effective the teaching at DWMA is. It would be awesome, and then we could... what? Oh, the video. Right. Here we go:
