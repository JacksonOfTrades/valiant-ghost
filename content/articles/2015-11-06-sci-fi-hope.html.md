Maddie Crum on The Huffington Post:

> Conceived of by Neal Stephenson -- a celebrated writer whose most recent novel ventures a guess at what post-Earth diplomacy might look like -- Hieroglyph showcases a growing crew of writers who, by commission or by choice, present sunnier alternatives to the now-prevalent, Hunger Games-fueled dystopia trend. These aren’t the stifling factions of Divergent or the heart-pounding twists and turns of The Maze Runner; they aren’t the bleak worlds crafted by Margaret Atwood or even the fable-like, anti-technology morals embedded in movies like “Wall-E.” Although many of the stories in Hieroglyph highlight societal problems, they have technological solutions to those problems embedded within them.

*Ringworld* by Larry Niven is one of my favourite science fiction novels of all time. Why? Because it presents a future I want to live in and be apart of without hesitation, of aliens, of teleportation and time travel, an amazing future. It’s a true classic, and today's science fiction novels, almost all of them presenting a very bleak outlook for humanity in the next centuries, cannot hold a candle to it in my mind.

And long after I'd given up on modern science fiction, I come across this article on the Huffington Post which gives me hope for the future of science fiction and where it can go. Hieroglyph seems like my kind of book, one that I hope to read someday[^1]. I look forward to the day when the stories presented in Hieroglyph are common.
