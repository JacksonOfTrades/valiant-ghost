As they should, they're my favorite publication. Because they're a bloody good one.

To prove my fanboyishness for *The Atlantic*: If I didn't restrain myself my site would essentially just become a feed of interesting reads on *The Atlantic*, effectivly turning my site into something similar to [Dave Winer's River's](http://scripting.com/#riverTab).
