Coming 2016 to SBS is a show about a wizard trying to live a normal life in our non magical world. A story done a million times over, but this time in Australia.

While it looks like a funny show about a wizard trying to blend in and live in suburban Australia, if you scratch the surface it looks like it goes into some slightly deeper issues about the racism that is present in Australian society, using wizards and all things magical to try and convey this.

For a low budget series, it looks pretty damn good. I'm seriously excited for when this comes out, and I'll definitely watch this.
