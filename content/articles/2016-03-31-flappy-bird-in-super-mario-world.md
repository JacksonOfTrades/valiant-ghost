No doubt you remember the game that took 2014 by storm, Flappy Bird. Well, by manipulating pixel perfect elements and certain glitches in Super Mario World by hand, Seth Bling, a video game engineer, has managed to have Flappy Bird recreated in Super Mario World. The variety of glitches writes certain elements in the memory, which makes this recreation possible. What makes this most impressive is that it was done with no actual mods done to the game or the console, just with his own two hands and hell of a lot of time. He also gives credit to SNES hackers MrCheeze and p4plus2 for helping him with this.
