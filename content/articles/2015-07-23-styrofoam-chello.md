> A last-year student of musical instrument manufacturing from the College of Ghent has made a cello with a Styrofoam cover. The instrument is the result of a search for new materials and techniques to produce more sound with less effort, compared to the regular wooden versions.

Who needs wood when you have ***styrofoam!***
