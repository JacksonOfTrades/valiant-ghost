Chaika Season 2 ep 1/Season 1 episode 13: Not sure which this is, but eh, more Chaika so I'm always happy. I quite liked the new opening, plus the show itself opened in a different way than you would expect. It's a month after the last episode, and Chaika and Co. are still trying to get the remains. But the hero they face this time is... different.
