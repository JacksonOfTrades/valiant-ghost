For me, Pokémon Go was released on Friday, and I haven't been able to play it due to a combination of [my lifestyle](https://valiantghost.com/2016/07/95/) and living in the [country](https://twitter.com/ManOTheClassics/status/750985993520443392)[^1]. But I have read a lot of news about it and... often it hasn't been good.

- For example, a teen playing Pokémon Go in Wyoming came across a [dead body while searching for Water Pokemon](http://gizmodo.com/teen-playing-pokemon-go-finds-dead-body-instead-report-1783368575).
- [Eleven teens were lured into a secluded Pokéstop and robbed at gunpoint.](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/pokmon-go-led-11-teens-right-into-an-armed-robbery). It's the modern 'Candy in my truck'. 
- One person has used a [drone to moderate effect to catch Pokémon](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/pokmon-go-led-11-teens-right-into-an-armed-robbery). 
- Here's a positive, [Pokémon Go is finally causing Americans to use the Metric system](https://twitter.com/Komodoco/status/751425418427850753). At least they are finally seeing what a logical system the rest of the world uses.
- Apparently the database Pokémon Go used is old-ish, because one [man living in a renovated church has had people trying to get into his house and get the pokemon](https://twitter.com/boonerang/status/751983397363445760) there.
