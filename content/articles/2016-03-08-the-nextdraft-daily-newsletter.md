I may be a bit slow on this, but thanks to [Kottke](http://kottke.org/) I stumbled upon this awesome daily newsletter by Dave Pell. It's kind of like a linkblog[^1] in your inbox, where Dave Pell collects the top 10 articles from 75 news sites, *by hand* and releases them as a newsletter. It's witty and informative, just like any linkblog should be. I think Pell's title of the Internet's managing editor is a very exact title for the man. Who else would deliver this to us? I'm not a big newsletter man, but I love this one. Subscribe already!
