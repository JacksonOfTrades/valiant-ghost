So I am now an official writery person. After seeing my internet friend [Jonas](https://twitter.com/korigaming) got a job at [Fighting for Nippon](http://fightingfornippon.com/) writing about anime I thought 'why the hell not', and signed up to be a volunteer writer. After some real life hardships that prevented me from writing I finally present to you my first article there: [The Humanity in Hellsing and Killing Alucard](http://fightingfornippon.com/kill-alucard-humanity-hellsing/). I originally wrote this for the [/r/anime writing competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4a6o24/the_ranime_writing_contest) but it was... not good[^1]. So here's the good one:



> ![With humanity you dolt](/images/killalucard.jpg)

> The *Hellsing* series by Kouta Hirano is perhaps best known as a ‘continuation’ of the original *Dracula* novel by Bram Stoker, where instead of being killed by Abraham Van Helsing and his team, Dracula instead becomes his loyal – and creatively named servant – Alucard. And 1999, one hundred years after the events of the novel Alucard is the most powerful weapon of Van Helsing’s descendant Integra Hellsing and the Hellsing Organisation.



> What makes Alucard the most powerful weapon is not his strength or ability, but rather his durability. He lives by the motto that “It takes a man to kill a monster” – As long as he believes himself to be a monster and his enemies to be nothing more than monsters like him – or dogs – he is fundamentally immortal. He refuses to die unless one he considers a man is a person to drive a stake through his heart – nothing divine, demonic, supernatural or anything in between. Until he takes the final stake through the heart by a human being, he will (un)live on.



> And despite *Hellsing*‘s ultraviolence and wacky humour, there’s a message that can be taken from Alucard’s talk of “It takes a man to kill a monster”, that of humanity. And if we could somehow find the humanity in Alucard, could we use whatever sliver we found to kill him?
