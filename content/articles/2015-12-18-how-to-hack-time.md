Do you remember this years brilliant movie [Kung Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg), an excellent homage to 80's action and cops films complete with its own 80's flickering filter? You might recall a scene in it where Hackerman, the mulleted up best hacker of all time hacks Kung Fury back in time to stop the Kung Fuhrer. The Hackerman himself has now released his own tutorial on how you too can hack yourself forward or backwards in time.

You can watch Kung Fury on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg) and on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/374570/). It's only 30 minutes long and well worth the time you'll spend laughing at the clich√©s.
