  though.

Katie Sola, Forbes:

> Sophia and Jackson[^1] are this year’s most popular names for girls and boys respectively, and new moms and dads were inspired by YouTube stars and young adult fiction.

> Seven Instagram filter names became more popular this year. The boy’s name Lux got the biggest Insta-bump. Lux is a light-adjustment tool on the app, and the name’s popularity increased by 75 percent. (Lux also  made some gains as a baby girl’s name.) Amaro, which gives photos a washed-out, high-contrast look went up 26 percent. Color-intensifying Ludwig went up 42 percent, and the faded-out Reyes is 10 percent more popular than last year.

Well at least they're kind of passable names for a person, not like [Mafia No Fear and 4Real](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/world/asia/new-zealand-stange-baby-names/).
