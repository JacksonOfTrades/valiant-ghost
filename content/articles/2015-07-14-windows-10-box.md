Yes. Windows 10 will come in a box. In this day and age! What is possibly the [last version of Windows](http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows) is getting a box. In 2015.

It might make a nice little museum piece, something you can display proudly when we're using Windows version 10.âˆž, remembering the good old days when we had to go and physically buy our Operating Systems. That is, assuming your not like me and you just throw it right into your 'miscellaneous items' storage box.
