> The Souls games never pull you out of the game world to force story upon you; character dialogue is brief, usually only a few lines, and only expounded upon should the player choose to repeatedly engage a character. The lore of the game is tied primarily into item descriptions on the inventory screen.

There's something refreshing about this, some games (Like the Elder Scrolls) will have you sit down and read a book if you want to delve deeper into the lore. I love books as much as the next bookworm, but for some reason I find reading a book in a game so damn boring. This 'minimalist'[^1] style of story telling is refreshing.

[^1]: I'm not sure how many of these 'minimalist' stories in games exist, but I'd love to find them. While the minimalist style of story telling seems to favor more artistic styles of games, I think many games like the Souls series work well with the story telling style.
