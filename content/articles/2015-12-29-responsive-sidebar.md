Here's what I use to make the sidebar responsive on this site. It may not be the best, but it does what it needs to and is clearly marked[^1]. It's a simple jQuery script I paired up with some CSS media queries to achieve the desired effect (See example below).

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/loweja/4/embed?html,css,js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.5"></script>

[You may want to view the full output to see the effect](http://output.jsbin.com/loweja) .Resize your window and reload at both desktop and mobile sizes to get the full effect.

It could be more elegant and I may improve it in the future. I'll update if I do.



[^1]: It's called ```sidebar.js```. Creative I know.
