![Free Speech](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)

Here's the hovertext, for anyone who can't get it (Like on mobile):

> I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.

All I can think of is when you're having an argument with a person and they tell you to shut up. It's pretty much a declaration of losing the argument behind some aggression because you have nothing else to say.
