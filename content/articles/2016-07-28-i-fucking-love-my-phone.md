As I lay in the bath watching the stuck in the middle with you scene from Reservoir Dogs[^4], all I can think about is how much I love the phone in my hands. It's a Sony Xperia M4 Aqua, a mid range phone I bought on my trip to England a year ago [^1] for 250â‚¬[^3]. And despite being a midrange phone, and an older model compared to the newly released M5, it's proved to be one the best phones I've ever owned.

I mean, I took photos like this on my phone's camera - 13MP. It almost makes bringing my DSLR with me almost useless in most situations. Of course, I still take it with me if I need it, but having it with me at all times is a comfort knowing I have a good camera.

And before when I was going housework for a solid hour all I did was listen to the [Dude Soup](http://funhaus.roosterteeth.com/show/dude-soup) podcast[^2]. The only thing my phone did wrong was to lose a single percent of battery, and this is despite often opening it to message people throughout, and occasionally skipping to YouTube when I wanted to listen to a song they referenced in the podcast.

It's an awesome phone if you need something that's both midrange, reliable and an awesome camera I would definitely recommend the Xperia M4. It's also so large that it doesn't fit in the pockets of some of my tighter jeans, but at the same time so thin that I can't help but love it. 

[^1]: Strange to think that it's almost been a year since I walked the streets of Scarborough at night with my granddad. 
[^2]: Been really getting into podcasts and audio books lately, especially when I do mind-numbing tasks like doing the dishes or running. I usually listen to Web Design ones, but if anyone knows any good anime podcasts (Currently listening to [aaaPodcast](http://www.aaapodcast.com) as I write this) tweet me with them.
[^3]: About 500 dollars for me. Not bad compared to a 1200 dollar iPhone. 
[^4]: I swear there's a reason for me to do it and not just a sadistic thingy. My friends planned to play a real life version of Gmod Murder tomorrow. I'm getting myself in the mood (As odd as it seems.)
