Robinson Meyer, *The Atlantic*:

> All journalists, but perhaps especially technology writers like myself, are basically  nap-deprived toddlers at a cereal bar. That is to say: We crave novelty. It’s our whole raison d’etre. If something is interesting and new, it is “better”—which is to say easier for us to write about than if something is boring and old.


> If this immediately seems to present several thousand ethical problems—*something being interesting and new has nothing to do with it being good!—*then you are correct; indeed, one of these ethical problems currently has [the same height and width as the Trump campaign](http://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/how-donald-trump-bent-television-to-his-will). But this tendency has far more mundane consequences, too: Tech journalists rarely write about staplers and loofas and toaster ovens and Allen wrenches—all important, productive objects in daily life—because they are old and boring. They are solved problems. They are background.

The article raises a good point, we're currently at the point where Smartphones are no longer a luxury item, simply something everyone owns. They've become less *awesome shiny new thing* and more common, and as they've reached a period of stagnation, where there're no major advances to be made instantly people, after all these years of constant upgrading, either the phone gets better *or* it gets bigger then, of course, we're going to feel deprived when only nothing *really* new is released, like the iPhone SE. 

Sure it's new but for the most part people really see that it's the internals of the iPhone 6 stuffed into the shape of an iPhone 5. That isn't new. It's just some of the old made shinier. Not good enough. So, in order for new exciting movements to be made phones need to start moving out into niche-r markets, photography, divers, things that will actually excite certain markets more than the mass audience. I do wonder how Apple will adapt to this. 

They'll probably just keep making their high-end, user-friendly devices they have always made. Which is good, because in striving out to the niche markets you don't want to leave behind the normal, everyday user. Although making the iPhone less shatter proof would be a good start. It's never happened to me, but its happened to a lot of my friends.
