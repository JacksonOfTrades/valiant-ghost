Here on Valiant Ghost I run a kind of hybrid link post/original writing style thing, especially lately as I've been on a holiday and had plenty of spare time to write here.  And using this free time, I've coded in working [link post RSS](/2016/01/middleman-linklog-rss-fix) to allow for this website to be a fully working linklog. And with this, I had to choose the design I'm going to use on this website for link posts. Arrows next to the titles is the common format, but I wanted something different.

Link Posts are told on the website itself by different color titles, rather than the arrow marker commonly used on linklogs. Link posts are the sites signature color[^1]  with a solid, thin underline underneath it and a spade icon next to the articles date to permalink to the article, while non-link posts are a simple black color with a dotted underline. I feel like the arrow is unnecessary in this format to tell if it’s a link post or my own writing, as the color helps enough. The RSS is another case altogether.   

In the RSS, I unfortunately can't tell any RSS reader[^2] what color the articles title should be, or anything beyond the content and the title. My main RSS follows the [DF style feed](http://daringfireball.net/). Original writing starts with this sites symbol, ♠, before the articles title. I did that for a little while here, but I found it again unsightly and unnecessary to use, but I found it needed in the RSS. Link Posts have nothing special about them, no symbol or arrow or anything, other than the fact the titles link out.

 I've considered changing this format for a while though, as to what [Shawn Blanc said in his article The Link Post](http://shawnblanc.net/2009/08/the-link-post/) about what he calls The Out and About (The Link post RSS style on this site):

> Your website is a non-communal, isolated starting point for your readers. If they follow your link, clicking the back button in their browser will return them to their starting point again, if need be. A feed reader, however, is more like a router piping in a whole community’s worth of stuff. If you follow a link out from your feed reader there is no back button to starting point; it’s buried in the feed reader.

> Beginning from an isolated starting point is especially great for the times when you’ve sent me to something I find unusually sweet. Once I’m there chances are good I’ll want to: (a) re-read your comments about why you sent them there in the first place; and/or (b) link to it myself and credit you for the find.

> If I got to the article directly from an Out and About Link in my feed reader then it’s up to my memory to remember who sent me there. Not a big deal if I’m eating lunch and am only taking the time to visit one or two new links. But that’s not how I most often consume stuff the Web.

> The way I read online is that at some point in my day I will open up my feed reader and read through the latest stuff. I rarely read articles in my reader — instead, I open them in Safari in the background. After I’ve combed through my feed reader I then go to the open tabs in Safari and start reading.

> At this point it’s not uncommon to have a dozen tabs with a dozen articles ready for me to read. Which is why – depending on your site’s posting rhythm and personality – sending people directly to your linked-to article is not necessarily the best design. Here’s why:

> Since my feed reader is filled with sites and folks I’m familiar with, the majority of the open tabs in Safari are websites I affectionately recognize. But if I come to a tab with a site I don’t recognize my first thought is usually,*what is this? Why am I here?*

I've considered switching to another style Shawn talks about in his post, called The DownUnder because - No, not because I'm Australian - but because of what Shawn says, that someone might click on a link and not know how they got there[^3] while the DownUnder allows for a similar style, but reversed. Using my own [Middleman RSS generator](/2016/01/middleman-linklog-rss-fix/) I could rewrite it easily enough, I would just have to switch around a few things. I'll see how it goes.

The [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/ValiantGhostCom) has a similar style, but link posts have an arrow after them. They still point towards this site though. 

I like the minimalism my design offers, as opposed to the arrow next to a title. I'm not the best at design, but what I've done here is the best I could probably do. I hope you like it.
