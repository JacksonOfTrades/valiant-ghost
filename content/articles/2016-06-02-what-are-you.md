So, what makes you... you? Is it our brain, which many think so? But if so [which brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8), the left or the right, is you? Or are you the [uncountable number of cells in you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQVmkDUkZT4), millions of which have died by the time your eyes hit this line? Do we argue that our soul is what make us human? Or is what makes us human simply our hardcoded desire shared by nearly all of use to just keep going?
