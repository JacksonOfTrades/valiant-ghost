If you aren't Patrick Star you probably heard about a thing called gravitational waves earlier this year, and how it proved [Einstein's theory of relavity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity). But that's cool and all but... what are they? I mean, I knew it was big[^1] but didn't really look into it much. And my favorite channel to watch when sick, [Minute Physics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHW94eEFW7hkUMVaZz4eDg) allows us Physics plebs[^2] to understand what they actually are.
