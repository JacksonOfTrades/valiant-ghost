> <p>There has been a lot of debate in the last couple years about <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2486597,00.asp">whether</a> <a href="http://www.inc.com/john-brandon/why-email-will-be-obsolete-by-2020.html">email</a> is <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/01/next-big-thing-missed-facebook-co-founder-says-email/">dead</a>. The advent of new workplace communication solutions such as Slack, Handbrake and Facebook at Work, and existing offerings from Yammer, Jive Software, etc., has added fuel to that fire. Yes, some offer cool technology like incorporating hashtags to create conversations, and can be useful. And, yes, some of these technologies will prove to be valuable, but they will not kill email.</p>

> Email is here to stay

I can't wait for the day when we're putting our Slack account on a resume instead of our email address.

It's actually quite laughable that anyone even thought Email *was* dying. Post offices in Australia are closing down due to email, and now that's dying too? It's just not happening.
