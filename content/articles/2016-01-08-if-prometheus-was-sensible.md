Here's a funny video from some Kiwi filmmakers I really love. If any of the characters in Prometheus (The Alien prequel) had any kind of logic, they probably wouldn't run directly under the big cartwheeling alien spaceship of doom(*!!!*).

Or as the video's description puts it: 

> Just. Be. Sensible.
