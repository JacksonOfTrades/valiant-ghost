I think one of the main reason a lot of people struggle in web publishing[^1] is that they see a very popular blog and thing *"I can do that!"*. So they make a website, buy the domain name (maybe) and start writing. Sadly, after a couple of months with little to no views or recognition they fizzle out and lose their passion for it, which is unfortunate because I think a lot of people could really succeed if they kept at it and took their writing talent to the web. What most people fail to see is that you *have to start small* in order to succeed and grow bigger.

Belle Beth Cooper on the Buffer blog put together a list of the huge services in use today and tells their origins, how they started and where they are now. Facebook[^2], the social networking megalith that now connects over a billion humans[^3], originally started as a way for college students to connect. Yahoo!, now the owners of Tumblr, started as a way to catalogue websites the founders wanted to visit later. Google, which has today <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/google-update.html">changed its logo</a> started as an algorithm to see which pages linked to each other.

I really don't know where I was going with this. In my mind it was supposed to be some hybrid link/inspiration post but I'm still not quite sure. I suppose, in short, start small. And then grow. No matter what you're doing, from writing an article for the web to writing a novel to taking over the world, start small. Don't start and expect you to just *become big overnight* you have to work for it. And work hard you must.

[^1]: When I say web publishing, I'm essentially talking about writing and publishing articles on the web. I feel like in today's world of Tumblr and microblogs like twitter, there needs to be a clear-cut difference between all the multiple forms of blogging in the blogosphere. When I say web publishing I mean sitting down to write engaging, thoughtful content, not post a short update of what you're doing or cute gif you find. These are all types of blogging, but they're all different types. (This is also a handy little test for my new [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com/) footnotes which I have recently added.)
