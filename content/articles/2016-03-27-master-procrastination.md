I've been watching a few TED talks lately, and boy do I wish I started watching them sooner. And during my viewing I came across [this talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator) by [Tim Urban](http://waitbutwhy.com/) that explains procrastination in a very silly, funny way, but in a way that overall gets its message across. No I was not procrastinating when I found this video. I promise[^1]!

[^1]: Okay, there are a few things I could be doing instead of watching random crap on the internet, like writing my physics report, my essay for the [/r/anime writing contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/4a6o24/the_ranime_writing_contest/) or trying to finish any of the books I borrowed off my family that I really need to return. Anyway...
