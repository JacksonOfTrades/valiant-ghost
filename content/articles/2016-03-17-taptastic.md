While I was trying to find a good manga reading app I stumbled upon Taptastic, an app for reading a stack of comics everyday. I like to think of it as Medium for web comics, each day Taptastic sends you five comics for you to read each day, your stack determined how popular it is in the community. In this stack can be a varied amount of comics, from comedy to manga[^1] to slice of life, whatever is trending. Using the app, you can subscribe to creators and support them if you like. Indivial creators can put their art up and Taptastic allows them to get money off of any ad reveue or donations. It's a nice little app, which offers you a small reading list each day. I would recommend. 

You can either [read on Taptastic's website](http://tapastic.com/), or download the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapastic) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapastic/id578836126?mt=8) app.

A couple of my favorite creators:

[Chris McCoy](http://tapastic.com/EndangeredComic), makes a comedy gaming comic. Pretty damn funny if you ask me.

[The Levesque Team](http://tapastic.com/projectlevesque). A new comic, but it seems to be more of a manga-esque story based idea than more of the funny [Oatmeal style](http://theoatmeal.com/) comics that Chris does.

[^1]: I guess I succeeded somewhat in finding a manga reading app.
