Why is it that for coffee the taste to price ratio is badly skewed. It seems that as coffee gets cheaper, taste gets better and vice versa: as coffee gets more expensive the taste goes down.

Is there some secret coffee society which dictates that richer people will buy expensive coffee just because it's expensive, and smaller coffeehouses and instant coffee companies don't comply by this dictation because they are smaller and not a part of the society[^1]?

My current coffee only cost 1.75 pounds, and it was some of the best coffee I'd ever had. But buy a 5 pound cup and it's the worst thing you ever tasted.

Where am I going with this? Absolutely nowhere. I'm just ranting about coffee. I'm sure you could apply this to some deep existential problem about capitalism or something, how as things get more expensive they degrade in quality but the consumer will buy them simply because they're expensive and **expensive is good[^2]** but I am just ranting about coffee.

[^1]: However, since they probably wouldn't be part of the society they probably wouldn't know about it and therefore wouldn't realized they're ignoring the dictation? Clearly I've thought of this way too much.
