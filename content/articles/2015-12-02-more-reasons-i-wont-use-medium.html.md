I've about this before, why I write here instead of on [Medium], but as I've started writing more original content[^1] lately I feel I may re-open the issue and state again why I will not use Medium for my writing.

### 1. No Markdown

I am a computer geek, and for the past two years ***literally everything*** I write is in Markdown. Stuff here? Markdown. Notes? Markdown. Email? Markdown using [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-here/elifhakcjgalahccnjkneoccemfahfoa?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon). I'm even writing this rant about Medium not having Markdown in [Markdown Edit](http://markdownedit.com/) which is quickly becoming my favorite markdown editor of all time. 

Sure, I could just use Medium's [import feature](https://medium.com/p/import) if I wanted to import an already existing post that I'd written in Markdown into Medium, but for the sake of this rant I'm talking about writing something purely for Medium, using Medium's editor.

This is 2015, nearly 2016. Nearly every major blogging/writing platform now days has Markdown, and there’s no real reason for Medium to use only a WYSIWYG editor. Sure, you could put up that WYSIWYG is an easier alternative for the average person, but the learning curve for Markdown is much lower compared to straight up HTML.  It probably wouldn’t be too hard for Medium to include the setting to use Markdown somewhere[^2].

Hell, even just supporting straight up HTML writing would be better, then I could convert the Markdown.

### 2. The logo looks stupid

I realise this is an incredibly minor thing to the overall experience of Medium, but I want to write about this and it’s easier to do this then write a separate post about it.

The logo is fucking stupid. At the start of this year the logo was a big white Serif M on a dark grey background. Now it is some wavy... thing in the shape of an M on a white background.

The original logo was something simple, and gave off the vibe I often get from Medium. Simplicity, only the words. Their logo was effective and simple branding.

The new logo is, well, weird. Geometric patterns in the shape of a slanted M. I have no clue what they're trying to convey with this logo? Are they trying to look like something unique, trying to draw in hipsters and kids that might not have considered the writing service before? Is it meant to look like a book? It eludes me.

### 3. No Footnotes

To a lot of people this may seem like a minor thing but to me this may be a clincher, right up there with no Markdown. My writing style is heavy on footnotes. Nearly every non-link post and some link posts I write will have a footnote in them. It’s just a part of my writing style[^3]. 

It's how I write. I can't change that. Sure, it may make my writing weaker, but as of now I don't feel the need or desire to change how I write.

### 4. And finally...

I don't consider Medium a blogging platform. It’s more a writing platform. Sure, to some people this may be more endearing than a blog, but to me it isn't. I like the level of control I have here. I'm a vain bastard. Valiant Ghost is mine. I am the only writer here. This is my site. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

P.S. I don’t hate Medium. I think it’s a great service for budding writers to get their thoughts out. I’m just saying why **I** prefer my own website.



[^1]: HA! Content. That implies what I'm making is good.
[^2]: I don’t know, maybe it is. Someone tell me if they are.
[^3]: If I didn't use footnotes, everything would be in parenthesis. Including this.
