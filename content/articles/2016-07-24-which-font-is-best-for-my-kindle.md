Mark Wilson over at *Fast.co Design*, about which font is best for your Kindle[^1]:

> Baskerville, Bookerly, Caecilia, Georgia, Helvetica, OpenDyslexic, Palatino, the mysterious "Publisher Font": According to my iPhone’s Kindle app, all of these typefaces are available with a button press, and that’s the problem. If you’re anything like me, as soon as you try to switch fonts, everything looks wonky and borderline illegible. And you burn 10 minutes going back and forth, squinting at serifs, and forgetting that you were supposed to be reading leisurely in the first place.
>
> I wondered, which typeface is the *right* typeface—easy to read, classy, and tonally appropriate for most books? Or at least, the best typeface most of the time? And to find out, I asked book and type designers their opinion on the topic.

> The quick answer may sound like a lot of setup for an obvious answer:


> **You should use whichever font you want to read at whichever size you prefer**. That’s probably the best font for you. (And if you want my personal recommendation? **Go with Georgia or Palatino**.)

As a font nerd[^3], my favorite part was after the quote, where he talks to a designer at Penguin Random house about she chooses which book has what font:

> Anna Thompson is a designer at Penguin Random House. She spends her days making the countless tiny decisions that go into any printed book that you read. That ranges from the typeface, to the spacing between letters, to the spacing in the margins, to whether or not a lot of words are breaking between lines with hyphens, to how wide the gutter line is (that’s the center space in books that separate the text on the left and right pages).


> "As far as a print is concerned, I’ll read a manuscript, pick up the nuances, think about the origin of a font, and an origin of a story," Thompson says. "There’s a lot of little nuanced things that go into picking a font, and sometimes it’s about the cast-off of a book—that’s basically the number of pages in a book. Books are still printed in signatures of 16 pages, which means your book has to fall on a multiple of 16. So there are all these tweaks you do, maybe the font is a little bigger, or you make the gutter margin a little bit wider because it’s thicker, so when you unfold the book, you're not going to get your text creeping too close to the center of the line."

There's so much work into setting the right font for a book and getting it right. Picking up two Penguin books now[^2] I can see a very clear difference between the font choices for both books. Nineteen-Eighty Four has a much bigger font, with bigger gutters, while Day of the Triffids seems to want to cram as many words on a page as possible. 

Nineteen-Eighty four is clearly easier to read, but Day of the Triffids has the advantage of being much smaller and portable. All thanks to how they were designed.

[^3]: Earlier this year I began writing an article on why we see more serif's in books, while more san serifs in books. I may get back into writing that, now what I am equipped with more knowledge on the subject.
