Despite the news that yesterdays release of Pokemon Sun and Moon was false, it turns out it was in fact true, as the Verge reports:

> At a brief online event today, Nintendo unveiled the next big Pokemon games: Sun and Moon. The two releases will be coming to the Nintendo 3DS in holiday 2016, and are the first major entries in the series since Pokemon X and Y in 2013. The titles for the games actually leaked out yesterday thanks to a trademark registration in Europe.

Recently I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Omega Ruby lately[^1] and to hear this news now gets me immensely hyped. I hope with the clear space theme [Deoxys](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Deoxys) [^2] will be involved.

[^1]: I'm actually playing it while I write this, [thanks NADD](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/nadd/).

[^2]: Who I am also trying to catch as I write this.
