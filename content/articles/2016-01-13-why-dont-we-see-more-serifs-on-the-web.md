I read a lot of books, completely because I like them. And if you've ever read a book you'll know they they're almost completely in serifs, but hardly ever in sans serifs. But on the Web where I spend a lot of my time reading also I find that a lot of the websites I read instead have sans serifs. But why? Why is there often a clear cut line between them, with sans serifs on the Web and serifs in print? 

For the uninformed, Serifs are those little curvy bits on the end of the letters and are used in print because multiple studies have found that serifs help reading text faster and with less eye strain then reading with sans serifs. So, Serif's seem tobe the obvious choice for reading... well anything really right?

On the web, not really. Serifs are at their most readable at 1000 dots per inch (dpi), which is the average for print work, while Sans Serif fonts are readable at only 100 dpi. And I've experienced this many times myself on the web.

I'm not ashamed to write this, but I write these words from a shitty laptop, which only cost me 400 dollars back in 2012. It's old and needs to be replaced, but its chugging along just fine, although the battery is terrible for using it not plugged in, and the case is falling apart. As you can guess from the year is was bought and the price point the screen is not exactly high resolution. Whenever I go to Khoi Vinh's [Subtraction.com](http://www.subtraction.com/), which uses a Serif font, the body text looks very low resolution for me.  Meanwhile [Kottke.org](http://kottke.org/), which uses a Sans Serif looks very readable for me.

This is not Khoi's fault, rather it is the fault of using a serif for such small text size. Serif's are best used in bigger text as opposed to the body text, headlines and the such while Sans takes the place of the body print, the complete opposite of print.

However, this is not only something negativly effecting me, but many people. According [to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_Display#Models) the highest dpi for an Apple product with Retina HD display is the Apple iPhone 6.

Now we can being to understand, very simply, why the Serif font is seen less on the web, compared to in print. It's better to read on a computer screen the simple style of a Sans Serif, compared to the complex shapes of a Sans Serif. 

But is it simply that it's easier to read? Or could we consider the formality a serif type is too harsh for a blog? The commonplace of serif type in newspapers and old documents gives serifs an air or elegance and authority, which a blogger trying to establish a friendly atmosphere on his blog may not want. Sans serifs are often used in children's books due to their simplicity of shape, and due to this we may invoke a kind of familiar, friendly nostalgia within us that allows for a more friendly voice it be conveyed by the writer. 

Because you can kind of ‘get’ a writers voice in his writing, and the font may help this. I like the writing of Shawn Blanc, I love his writing on creativity and focus[^1]. And I feel that his use of a sans serif font on his website helps convey the friendliness of his voice, along with the writing. Kottke.org also has a very friendly writing style to it, and it also uses a serif font. 

Another writer I love,  Ben Brooks at the Brooks Review uses a serif font. Brooks writes powerfully, and had made an impression on me as a writer. However, I feel that his use of a serif font on his blog (Currently) adds to this, giving his powerful writing  a bigger feel of authority. Zeldman, also a prolific writer I admire, also uses a serif font, and this to my mind helps him convey his strong messages better. 

It can also help in just plain old design for trying to convey a message. 

And of course, maybe that's why I don't use a serif on this site. I tried. It just feels odd. I don't consider myself that great of a writer, despite being told I do I feel I lack a strong voice in a lot of the things I write here. so the use of a serif font feels too strong for me. The Sans Serif font helps make me feel like I dont need to contact put out something that is
