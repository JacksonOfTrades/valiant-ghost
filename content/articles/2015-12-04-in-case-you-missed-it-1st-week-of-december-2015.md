### [Seriously, Don’t Use Icon Fonts or: Don't be Table Guy ](http://blog.cloudfour.com/seriously-dont-use-icon-fonts/)

A word of advice on why you should not use Icon Fonts on any websites.

### [The original Fallout 3 looked awesome](http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/16/9746264/fallout-3-van-buren-chris-avellone-nyu-practice-2015)

>  Longtime fans of Fallout may still bristle at the name "Van Buren"; that was the codename for the original <i>Fallout 3</i>, which was cancelled by former series publisher Interplay Entertainment following a company shift away from PC titles. Eventually, the Fallout license was taken over by Bethesda Softworks and <i>Fallout 3</i> was completely reimagined, but the Van Buren project in its original form was never realized.

>Those who still long for Interplay's third Fallout — from which some&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nma-fallout.com/article.php?id=1594" target="_blank">story and gameplay details</a>, as well as a&nbsp;<a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Van_Buren_tech_demo" target="_blank">tech demo</a>, have eked out over the years — would have likely found Van Buren designer Chris Avellone's talk at&nbsp;<a href="http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/practice/" target="_blank">NYU Game Center's Practice 2015 conference</a> about the game's pen and paper roots to be both exciting and heartbreaking.

> Avellone, whose credits include titles like <i>Fallout</i>, <i><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.polygon.com/game/planescape-torment/6884">Planescape: Torment</a> </i>and <i>Alpha Protocol</i>, spoke at the annual summit on all matters of game design. His talk detailed how his lifelong interest in games like Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop RPGs played a part in the design of <i>Fallout 3: Van Buren</i>. His hourlong presentation included a plethora of photos, showing off the unique and detailed binders he created to aid the game's designers, elaborating on such facets of the game as character roles, the bestiary and the areas of exploration.

For those of you with a Fallout love (like me) then you may be happy to know there’s an unofficial [Fallout Pen and Paper rule book](http://falloutpnp.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) similar to what’s described here. While its no Fallout 3 Van Buren, its pretty cool in how its made.

I've even made characters and characters for it.


### [My Frebble - This is a thing and I have no idea why its a thing](http://myfrebble.com/)

The internet has made some weird things[^1] but this is kind of weird. The Frebble advertises itself as:

> ... an accessory designed to allow you to hold hands with someone at a distance: when you squeeze it, the other person feels your squeeze. The shape holds you; you hold the shape" and 

> Children love it: they can now hold hands with their father on a business trip, their grandmother in another country, a best friend who moved away, or maybe just a friend next door"

This sounds like something from a really low budget family movie where the dad always works away, and at the start of the movie you see the kid using this to communicate with their dad.

It's just weird.

### [How Twitter designs emails](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/designing-with-constraint-twitters-approach-to-email)

Really interesting outline as to how twitter designs the emails it sends as notifications sometimes. Clean and straight to the point. I like it.

### [Another book to buy once I get more money - When Clowns Attack: A Survival Guide](http://www.amazon.com/When-Clowns-Attack-Scariest-People/dp/1607747030)

You don't need the Zombie Survival Guide, you need this guide.

### [What I’ve learned in 11 years working at the Chicago Tribune](https://medium.com/@pang/what-i-ve-learned-in-11-years-working-at-the-chicago-tribune-c81df4851bea#.uknqeyj85)

Kevin Pang:

> In my younger days, I was an insufferable colleague (some would argue with “was”). I was dismissive of other people’s ideas. Maybe it was because I was an incorrigible 23-year-old, freshly hired at the Chicago By God Tribune, and thought I was hot shit. Nope.

> Soon I would be humbled and put in my place. Today, I tell my dear colleagues I’m most thankful for their patience. I wished I could have told that 23 year old however high of a pedestal he places himself, he really has so much to learn. I would have pulled that kid aside and told him a few things, and it might have saved him — and the people he work with — a lot of grief.


Probably some good advice for writers here. As an attempted[^2] writer here, I find it helpful. 

### [Well, I guess I'm moving to Tokyo now](https://medium.com/@damjancvetkovdimitrov/these-photos-are-why-i-m-trapped-in-tokyo-forever-now-1a0ea980bcc5#.thuvmctad)

Holy crap I want to go to Tokyo after seeing this awesome images of the city. One ticket please! 

Edit: I realise I didn't do last weeks, mostly because there were only two links this time. Here they are now.

### [This is a tag on Zeldman.com and I have no clue why its there but I love it.](http://www.zeldman.com/category/this-never-happens-to-gruber/)

Exactly what it says in the title.

### [A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=A+long+time+ago+in+a+galaxy+far,+far+away)

No words, just click it. You can probably guess what it is :).
