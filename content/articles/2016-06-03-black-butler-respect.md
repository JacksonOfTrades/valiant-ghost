Black Butler: Book of Circus has surprised me significantly. Initially, I thought it was continuing on the story of Season 2[^1], but no. It is rectifying an issue I have with a lot of anime series adapted from the manga; eventually, the anime series catches up and diverges from the manga, often having a weaker story due to it. 

But the creators of the Black Butler anime realised their mistake and are now going back to continue the story of the manga, rather than the ending of Season 2. I can respect that. I wish more series (Akame Ga Kill for example) did the same thing. 

[^1]: And the first episode kind of tricks you into thinking that.
