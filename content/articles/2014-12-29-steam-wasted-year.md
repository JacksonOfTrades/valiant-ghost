What did happen with Steam Machines? It seemed like in late 2013, everyone was psyched about the new Linux based consoles coming out, and they would kill other Consoles with its PC superiority. But come the end of 2014 and no sign of the machine or the OS is in sight.

My theory is that they both reached Beta (2) stage and Valve gave up [^1].

[^1]: In the event it went over your head, its a joke on the fact Valve has never made a trilogy. All their games end in 2, Half-Life, Left 4 Dead, Portal, Team Fortress are all stuck at 2 for now.
