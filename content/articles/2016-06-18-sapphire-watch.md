Jim Shi, Bloomberg:

> Cut from a single large sapphire crystal, including the rounded, multi-angular case horns, the entire movement is flooded with light within its 38.4mm case, allowing a view into its multi-tiered design from all angles. This is a more complicated watch than the Hublot, and uses sapphire in more places, including the crown. 

Not for me, I personally prefer skeleton watches. Still, cut form a crystal. It's honestly impressive. L
