Very few of us can call looking like a piece of shit a good thing, but for the Bird-dung crab spiders it's pretty damn useful as Agata Blaszczak-Boxe writes for New Scientist: 

> Most other creatures out in the open would be like sitting ducks. But these spiders have a trick up their sleeves – they mimic bird droppings in colour, shape, size and smell, deceiving predators. When they draw their legs close to their body and stop moving, the masquerade is complete.
> 
> “Birds, almost all with good eyesight, will not go for what appears to be their own turd for food,” says [Joseph K.H. Koh](http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/dna/people/details/30) of the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum in Singapore.
> 
> The spider’s body has a glossy surface that gives it a “wet” look of fresh faeces, says Koh. “The nodules on the body and rough-edges of the legs further reinforce the ‘shitty’ look – pardon the rudeness,” he says.
> 
> When the spider moves, the illusion disintegrates. “The ‘walking poop’ no longer looks like a piece of dropping, especially with its legs spread out,” Koh says.

Clever girl.
