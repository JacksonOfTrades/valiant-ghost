[Speaking of my](http://valiantghost.com/2016/05/67/) Fate/Grand Order team I'm thinking of changing around certain aspects of it. For example, I'm going to have Nero up front and Attila at the back, EMIYA (Archer) is going to be replaced with EMIYA (Assassin) and I'm still not sure whether to replace Helena for Irisviel or not.
