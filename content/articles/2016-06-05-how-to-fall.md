Rhian Sasseen, The Awl: 

> For a brief span of about one spring, I was obsessed with learning how to fall. This is not a metaphor; when I say I was learning, I mean that I typed “how to fall” into a search engine and discovered the surprisingly robust world of YouTube falling tutorials.

Or you can get on my level. After an entire life of falling, due to an uncoordinated body never meant to play sports or operate dexterous machinery, I can now fall with as much grace as possible. Combined with a lifetime experience in tripping and OCD giving me a general fear of germs, I have mastered the art of falling and reducing the amount of surface area hit as much as possible.
