One of my favorite stand up comedy recordings of all time, Jim Gaffigan on kale. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the full recording but here's an expert from it.

If this went on longer, or began quicker, then we would've heard Jim talk about how through his life he's lived with all these superfood fads, from all the different kinds of milk to cream cheese "Because to get healthy you eat things that look like cellulite". I think kale is this. Just another thing that's *really* popular right now, but will soon fade away/
