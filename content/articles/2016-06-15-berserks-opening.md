I'm on the second episode of Berserk, and I'm not *sure* about the opening music/scene of each episode. The terribly tuned guitar opening and the cheery lyrics in broken English that contrast heavily with what I see on screen.

It's not necessarily a bad song, it's just odd and contrasting with the rest of the show.
