I now understand why [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-i-slack/) loves keyboard shortcuts so much. It's one of those things you don't miss until they're gone. My mums currently resting on my arm on a flight from Christchurch to Auckland, and CTRL is just out of reach. Meaning I have to use the mouse to open a new document. ***LIKE A PLEB.***
