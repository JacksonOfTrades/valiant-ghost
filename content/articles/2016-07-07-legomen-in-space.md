As I'm sure we all know, [The Juno spacecraft recently got into orbit around Jupiter](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasas-juno-spacecraft-in-orbit-around-mighty-jupiter), marking the end of a five year-long journey. But a fun little factoid is that the spacecraft also carries Lego figurines made from ['space-grade aluminum'](http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-080411a.html) of Jupiter (Zeus), Juno and Galileo, shrouded in a thermal blanket to keep them nice and cozy.
