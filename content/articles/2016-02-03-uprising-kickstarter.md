title: Uprising, a robot apocalypse about family

I can't be the only one who thinks this, a robot comedy apocalypse about family, a bunch of nerds, and teabagging robots, is gonna be awesome. 

Yes, teabagging robots: 

> Four lovable supernerds - yearning for respect - create an A.I. to win videogames. It gets loose and starts fragging humanity. Whoops.


> Beneath the comedy and glorious action, Uprising is actually a story about **family**. In fact, most of the concept came to me when my son was an infant, and I'd take long walks with him late at night. Within this absurd setting, our four human Heroes fight for each other (and with each other) like **Brothers**. Two of the robots - our film's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern - save a human baby and decide to raise it as their own. (Hint: Worst. ***Parents***. Ever.) Even the decisions of the master A.I. 'Caster', weirdly mirrors the decisions I had to make as a new ***Father***.


> On top of that there's life-sucking Roombas, self-driving Priuses that hunt humans in packs, vigilante Soda Machines, and Celphones that send your Snapchats to your Mom.


> And of course... **ROBOTS!** These metal monsters think the #ROFLpocalypse is just a game - so they get busy tea-bagging, dry-humping, and Leader-boarding humanity out of existence. 

Just like any good movie, Uprising looks to inform and entertain you at the same time. You can help fund Uprising [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/491655051/uprising-a-post-apocalyptice-robot-comedy)
