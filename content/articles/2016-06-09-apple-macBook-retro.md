A retro skin for a limited run of 10 12" MacBook Pro's done by Colorware:

> You wanted more Retro, so we're giving it to you. This time it's the 12" MacBook that's getting the Retro treatment.



> What's the Retro look? It's inspired by the Apple IIe, but with the sleekness and power of the current 12" MacBook. The design is reminiscent of the 1980s. The rainbow logo illuminates when the machine is powered up. The putty color and faux vents add to the nostalgia without taking away any of the features of the current MacBook that you love.
