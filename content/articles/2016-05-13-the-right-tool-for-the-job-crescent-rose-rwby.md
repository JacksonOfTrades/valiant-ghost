*Welcome to* The Right Tool For The Job *a column series where I attempt to give a highly objective analysis and review of a weapon from an anime series, eventually leading up to the question of whether I myself would use it. Alucard may be one of the coolest vampires clad all in red, but his two massive handguns are often associated with him as much as his floppy hat and glasses. Akame Ga Kill has a lovely cast of characters, but their Imperial Arm's are pretty interesting even without the people. Note that each column in this series will likely lead to spoilers about the series. You have been warned.*

The High-Caliber Sniper-Scythe (HCSS) "Crescent Rose" is the personal weapon of Ruby Rose, the main protagonist of *RWBY*, a series where literally everything is also a gun[^1]. That hammer,  also a grenade launcher. That sword turns into an M1 Garand or a spear. And Crescent Rose is no different. By combining the badassery of a scythe and a .50 caliber rifle the result is...

### The most dangerous weapon

... And it's wielded by a 15-year-old girl and her alcoholic uncle. But both of them have more skill than you and I could ever be. Ruby's Crescent Rose is based on her uncle Qrows weapon, and according to Ozpin, the Dumbledore to RWBYs Beacon Academy, Gun Scythe's are some of the most dangerous weapons ever designed. 

And why would such weapons exist? The same reason all weapons exist in anime. To kill monsters, whether they be the literal, like in RWBY, or the more metaphorical, like Alucard's guns. RWBY has literal monsters, The Grimm, manifestations of destruction drawn to negative emotions. 

But of course, with the massive risk and skill involved in the use Crescent Rose to fight these monsters comes a massive reward. In her first appearance in the [Red Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYW2GmHB5xs) Ruby single-handedly decimated an entire pack of Beowolves all by herself, an obvious harkening back to the tale of Little Red Riding Hood. 

The fighting style of the girl in the red cloak is entirely dependent on the fact the scythe is the holy love child of a scythe and a .50 caliber rifle. While some people might have trouble switching between using the weapon as both a sniper rifle and a scythe at the same time, or compensating for the massive recoil, Ruby has none of these issues. Instead, she uses the recoil to her advantage, using it to deliver her strikes harder and faster than they would be otherwise.

Crescent Rose comes in three forms, a compact form that Ruby can easily hold on her waist, a bolt action rifle form and its final form(s) the gun-scythe, where she can use the long range capabilities of the .50 caliber rifle with the short-range components the scythe offers. The head of the scythe can also swivel outwards, allowing for a longer range of Crescent Rose and making each shot  allow for a rotation if her whole body rather than recoiling her back.

I am honestly wondering about the point of the bolt action rifle form. As Ruby suffers no perceivable detriment to her accuracy when using the rifle in its scythe form, and the recoil seems to be the same across forms, allowing for Ruby's acrobatic moves. In the Red Trailer, she was shown to do some kind of 'power' shot from CR in its rifle form, which seems to do the exact same damage as a normal shot in Scythe Form. O

### Would I Use It?

Nope. Not in a million years. Crescent Rose is a weapon designed for those who are coordinated, skilled and know what they're doing. So y'know, not me. Of course, by using some of Ruby's techniques for reducing recoil (stabbing the blade into the ground) it could effectively be used awkwardly as a bolt action sniper rifle, but due to its lack of a scope in scythe form and the heavy recoil in its rifle form, I would have to pass this weapon up.

That's not to say I dislike Crescent Rose, in fact, I love the scythe as a weapon, not matter how impractical it may be in a real world context. And combining a scythe with a .50 caliber sniper rifle... Well, it just can't be beaten.
