You may remember a couple of months back when the [U.S. Web Design Standards was released](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) and if you looked through the code then somethings seemed... weird. The use of having a ```us``` be the first word in every ```div``` included. 

If you wonder why, then you should listen to the Big Web Show 136, a podcast by [Jeffery Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/) where he talks to one of the designers behind the product. A lot of the choices as to why everything is where it is is explained to us here.
