With all the Windows 10 news, I found this little bit interesting:

> Cortana will reside on the toolbar at the bottom of the Windows 10 home screen, replacing Windows' embedded search feature. In addition to allowing users to find applications and execute commands by typing them in, Cortana allows users to give voice commands by saying "Hey Cortana" to alert the feature to an incoming voice command or search.

Combined with the [news on the Spartan browser](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/01/microsoft-unveils-project-spartan-the-browser-after-internet-explorer/), the day I can say 'Hey Cortana, run Spartan program' my life will be a little bit closer to being complete.
