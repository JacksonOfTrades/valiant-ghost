James Vincent, The Verge:

> Earlier this year at CES we were introduced to Remix OS — an Android variant from Jide that turns google's mobile operating system into a desktop OS. Remix takes basic Android and adds all the elements you'd expect on a PC or Mac: there's support for mice and keyboards, a windowed interface, a file manager, system bar, and a dock at the bottom of the screen for your apps. And because its based on Android, it already has a load of apps ready to use — from Facebook and Microsoft Word to Clash of Clans and Candy Crush Saga.

Honestly, this could work out great. A few years ago you could've scoffed at this, but today my phone can work awesomely as more than just a phone[^1].  I'm writing this on my Android phone in Jotterpad, and thanks to Heroku I'm now going to be deploying on this phone. If I was willing to free up some space I could probably find a text editor that could edit the files I need for this site[^2]. 

Hell, I may knock Apple and iPhone's a fair bit but you can deploy a [Jekyll](http:// jekyll to.com)  site from [the iPhone](https://www.jordanmerrick.com/posts/a-static-site-generator-for-workflow). Soon phones might be so advanced they might be on par with our desktops.
