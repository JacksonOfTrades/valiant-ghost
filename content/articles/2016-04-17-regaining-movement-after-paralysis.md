Ed Yong writing for *The Atlantic*, about a team helping a young man regain movement of his arm after he was paralysed in an accident:

> In April 2014, the team surgically implanted an array of microscopic electrodes in Burkhart’s motor cortex—the part of the brain that governs his movements. When Burkhart thought about moving his arm, the implant would decode the activity in his neurons and feed the signals to a sleeve of electrodes on his forearm. In theory, his arm would move.
