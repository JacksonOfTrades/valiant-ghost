On the 26th it will have been 30 years since Chernobyl's reactor number four exploded during a test, which caused 120,000 people to evacuate. *The Atlantic* gives us 35 photographs from Chernobyl today, along with the plan to cover the damaged reactor with a giant metal dome so that the reactor can be safely dismantled. Yes, [a giant metal dome](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-chernobyl-arch-idUSKCN0WP2TB). Although the disaster has allowed local wildlife to flourish in the absence of humans, along with giving us the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.
