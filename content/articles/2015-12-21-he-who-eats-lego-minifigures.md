You think the monster that eats your socks is bad? Try having one that eats your Lego minifigure’s instead. It's much, much worse.

It has happened twice now that I suspect the monster that eats my Lego minifigure’s has come to my house. I have left them sitting on my desk, unaware for them except for odd moments where I glance over to them when my eyes need a break. And slowly the time progresses from days to a full week, and when you glance back at them, maybe to try and take a funny photo with them they're gone. And every time, I look where they should be and what do I find? 

A single item from the minifigure. One of them, a dark knight I made when I was 13 to put on top of some display I made for history. I know exactly where I left him, but when I go to look there again all I can find is his helmet. No figure in sight. Next, it was a Brute figure[^1]. I know it was behind my laptop, among the tangle of cords, but when I go to look there all I can find is its blaster.I searched high and low for it. I pulled the desk back from its corner, I looked under the piles of books. In my camera bag. Under my camera bag. I cannot find the figure, only its blaster. I suspect that this is its calling card of sorts, similar to how my cat always leaves the stomach of the rabbit it killed behind, a way to let you know that this beast did in fact come and devour your poor defenceless lego man.

When faced with the possibility of there being a monster that eats my Lego minifigure’s, I will take no chances. I need defence against this thing. Once it realises that 'Hey, these small humans taste nice, what about a big human?' then I will be in very serious danger. If anyone knows of a way to combat this beast, please contact me immediately. This monster must be slain before he can cause any more damage to the Lego minigifure population of my desk.
