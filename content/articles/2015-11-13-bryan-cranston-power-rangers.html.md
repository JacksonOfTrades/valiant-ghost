No matter what you remember Bryan Cranston as, bumbling dad or drug lord, never forget that he was once on Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers[^1]:

> I did voice work for the Power Rangers years and years ago. Someone once told me they named the blue Power Ranger after me, his last name was Cranston. I found out years later that was true.
