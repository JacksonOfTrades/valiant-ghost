Behold, the creation of a real life Excalibur, personal blade of Arturia, from the Fate series[^1] by Baltimore Knife and Sword Co., for the Man At Arms:Reforged series. The main creator of Excalibur's blade is a massive fan of the Fate series, and uses a method that involves melting down real life medieval weapons in order to produce the blade. 

[^1]: Or ***Ekusu-Caribahhhhhh!*** If you prefer.
