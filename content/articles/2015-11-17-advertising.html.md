#### YOU ARE THE 1 MILLIONTH VIEWER TO THIS SITE! CLICK HERE TO CLAIM YOUR PRIZE!

It's happened to you dozens of times before. There you are, browsing away onto anything, whether it be in the pursuit of knowledge or procrastination and *it* pops up. An advertisement. Your 25th one you've seen today. You ignore it and scroll further down. And there, along the right of the content is an ad for a dating site, which has little to significance to you. You go down further and see another 10 ads. Enough is enough you declare, and install adblock. A faster, quicker web experience.  But, did you ever consider the negative effects of this? There aren't any, right? 

Advertisements are one of those things that are here forever and show no signs of going away despite how much we try. But in recent years the advent of advertising on the Web, how it’s done and the want to stop them from spreading further has created something of a divide between the good and the bad ads, summarizing them under the general parasol of 'ads'.

### Ads have always sucked, period

Let’s be honest, ads in the early days of the Internet sucked. They were slow, bloated and promised things like **You are the 1 millionth visitor to this website. Click here to claim your money/Macbook/Car**. These populated and polluted most websites. They were big, flashy, distracting from the main content and worst of all made the pages incredibly slow.

When Google's AdSense was a fresh face in the advertising field it was a provider of decent looking ads, but eventually degenerated to be no worse than the ads that were presented in the early days on the web. It was these ads that made the coming of adblockers nigh impossible to stop. 

Ask any of your tech savvy friends and they will probably tell you to use an adblocker to allow for an easier, cleaner web experience. And Apples recent allowing of Adblockers on iOS9 devices has made ad blocking come to a large part of the mobile web world. Advertisements are undoubtedly the bane of a lean web experience. But they are also the life of it. 

Earlier this year YouTuber ManyATrueNerd released a video on [Tidal, the Spotify  competitor, and how to fund the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUHMKP17GqQ). He points out that Tidal is a terrible way to run a service, exclusive content behind a subscription paywall that you can't get from anywhere but the service, Spotify and YouTube are wonderful ways to run the Internet, you get the content for free, even if you have to sit through an ad. And he's not wrong. Most popular websites run this way, even articles.

But ManyATrueNerds perspective is skewed *only* to YouTube and not the web as a whole. He likes the idea that adblockers not be used because it gains him, and other YouTubers, revenue. However, on most websites this is used to a disadvantage on popular text driven periodical websites. The Forbes website has an entire column dedicated to advertisements. In some cases these advertisement divides the article in half.

Why would websites do this, if it provides detrimental to the reader? Why would they reduce the readability of their site and put something large and distracting there?

As always, the lovable Jon Gruber of Daring Fireball shares with us a reason why:

> But so why then am I defiling a minimalist design with ads from Google? Undeniably, the ads are both unattractive and distracting, neither of which adjectives are generally associated with making anything “better”.
> 
> Let’s not mince words. The answer is money. Well, and time, since time truly does equal money. And I’m not talking about merely covering my hosting expenses. I’m talking about generating a reasonable portion of my income from this web site.

I have no qualms about this goal.

This is why ads are used on websites. They need money to run, to pay for hosting and to pay the writers. It's an obvious trade off, you get ads, and you get free content. But the ads used on most websites are terrible and distract from the main content. 

This is why Apple seem to be the heroes we all need and deserve when they allowed ad blocking on iOS, and why people who use Adblock feel like they are screwing over big ad networks that are trying to sell their information. But they aren't. They are mostly screwing over those who run the ads on their site. 

It's often a simple case of without Ads, the internet can't run. When Apple blocks ads on their device, they're screwing over Google, their main competitor in the mobile world and also one of the biggest data sellers, but by doing so they are also screwing over those who use the web. Without the funding that Google gets by selling our information to advertising providers the search engine giant will become slower, and so will every other search engine provider. This dooms the web to be even worse potentially worse than when we had ads, a slow experience where everything requires a subscription to run. 

### Where can we go from here?

We don't want the bloated ads of yesteryear and yet we still need to fund the web. How? There are simply horrible approaches to this, like what The Next Web does at time of writing. They have one of the most intrusive advertisement forms available, they remove most of the content and slid a big ad in front of you.

 The most unobtrusive way is simply something along the lines of what [The Deck](http://decknetwork.net/) or [Carbon](http://carbonads.net/), these are ad networks, but they are *tasteful* ad networks. It was the Deck that moved Marco Arment to remove his iOS ad blocker Peace from the Apple App store after only 36 hours.

He cites his reasons as:

> Achieving this much success with Peace just doesn’t feel good, which I didn’t anticipate, but probably should have. Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve the hit.
> 
> Peace required that all ads be treated the same — all-or-nothing enforcement for decisions that aren’t black and white. This approach is too blunt, and Ghostery and I have both decided that it doesn’t serve our goals or beliefs well enough. If we’re going to affect positive change overall, a more nuanced, complex approach is required than what I can bring in a simple iOS app.

And on the Deck

> The Deck is unusually well-behaved for an ad provider: its ads are small, unintrusive, non-animated, and classy, and while it’s loaded by a third-party JavaScript include, it doesn’t set cookies or perform any tracking. That’s why I publish Deck ads on this site, and why many of my friends and colleagues do as well.

The fact that the Deck ads are good and clean committed Marco to pull his app is an example of good ads, compared to the ads used on old websites. They can set an example for where advertisements can go from here.

Of course, we could go the way of donations, money donated voluntarily. But the most likely this will end with little to no money generated.

### Coda

Ads: Can't live with them, can't live without them.  Yes, they suck. You can't deny that. But they suck like taxes suck. You don't want them, but we need them to make sure the overruling body survives. If ads want to survive on the web, they need to go the way of The Deck. Small, simple, non-tracking and overall benefiting the web. If we don't, than the war between Google, Apple and Adblock may end the web for us. And we don't want that.
