*Welcome to* The Right Tool For The Job *a column series where I attempt to give a highly objective analysis and review of a weapon from an anime series, eventually leading up to the question of whether I myself would use it.*

When I first started playing the [Aardwolf MUD](http://www.aardwolf.com), my character was a Paladin Inquisitor, meaning he started the game off with a proficiency in whips. And for the year or so I played that game whips were the only weapon my character used. Since then, I've had an affinity for any character in anime who uses a weapon even remotely similar to whips.

The Monofilament Wires of Walter C. Dornez, butler to the Hellsing Organization are not traditional whips, but they are utilized exactly the same as I envisioned them in Aardwolf. Quick, slender, skillful. If used right, they can lead to a clean death with maybe one or two limbs missing. He has shown such exceptional skill that only a slight twitch of his fingers is enough to kill five men with the wires.

The Monofilament wires are incredibly thin and sharp, so much so that they are near invisible until they need to be seen. Walter has been shown cutting through armor, vampires, ghouls and even entire buildings with the cold hardened precision that his old age, and the incredible length and sharpness of the wires, offers.

One of the abilities the Monofilament Wires which my Aardwolf whips lacked is the ability to take control of an individual, as he showed with the Baskerville-regurgitated Luke Valentine. Through some form of Hellsing Wizardry, Walter manipulates each wire[^1] into the body of the poor artificial vampire and puppeteers half of Baskerville with relative ease.

The speed, flexibility, and skill of the Monofilament wire makes it something I want. Right now. Unfortunately, is seems to be something only manufactured by the Hellsing Organization, but that can't stop me from believing!

### MONOFILAMENT WIRE

Pros: 

- Effective at nearly any range.
- Insanely accurate.
- Can deflect bullets, even the explosive and armor piercing shells of Alucard's Jackal.
- Sharper than paper forged in the fire of hell.

Cons:

- Unknown how to manipulate them, good luck not cutting yourself, or the people around you, in half.

[^1]: Not sure how many wires there actually are, but I'm guessing one wire for every finger.
