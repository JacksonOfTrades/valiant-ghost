I have found an issue with [my lifestyle](https://valiantghost.com/2016/04/living-in-perpetual-airplane-mode/). I can't play [Pokemon Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo)... on the go. Which kind of makes the game redundant for me. Doubly so [that I live in the country](https://twitter.com/ManOTheClassics/status/750985993520443392).
