No, unfortunately this is not a knock-off of [Sharknado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharknado). Nope, there was literally spider rain. 

Oddity Central:

> Earlier this month, the residents of Goulburn – a small town in Australia’s Southern Tablelands – were spooked to discover their properties blanketed by millions of tiny spiders and mounds of their silky threads. The spiders had apparently rained down from the sky, silken thread and all, a phenomenon known as “Angel Rain”.

Angel Rain, it sounds cooler but also lamer then Spidernado. If I were to buy a movie, I would definitely buy a movie called 'Spidernado' then 'Angel rain'.
