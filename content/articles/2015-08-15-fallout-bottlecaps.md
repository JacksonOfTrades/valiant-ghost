You may have heard that one man sent [2,240 bottle caps to Bethesda](http://imgur.com/gallery/tYZPO) and got a copy of Fallout 4 for it. Well, Game Theory took it to make a video on whether the man made a profit with it.

Two things I have wrong with this video:

1. Bottle caps have been fabricated twice, [once as part of a quest](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Pressing_Matters) and one [random bottle cap counterfeiting shack](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Cap_counterfeiting_shack).

2. He failed to count in the transistor relative to the time split, which means the time split was more likely to be in 1948 to 1949, according to [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/falloutlore/comments/1rok5q/geneva_convention_in_fallout/cdpfu4v).
