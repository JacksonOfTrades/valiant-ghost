Servamp Episode 1: Just picked this up, and my first thought is way too much exposition. We are *told* the MC is losing conciousness, when it is clear he is, and the film fails the [Dead Parent test](https://valiantghost.com/2016/07/dialogue-in-films/). The MC suffers way too much from a Emiya Shirou complex, in that he has a belief put onto him by his adoptive father and holds onto it for dear life, and I can see this series borrowed a lot from *Fate* in its Servant system[^1]. It has an interesting enough concept for vampires however, the main Servamp (Servant + Vampire), rather than burning to a crisp in daylight instead turns into a cat. I'm not sure if this is a show for me, but I can see it working well if the exposition issues are fixed.

[^1]: There's a Master, who is bonded to a Servant who will do whatever the Master says. Although this series has a magical chain formed between them and the Servamp doesn't need Command Seals.
