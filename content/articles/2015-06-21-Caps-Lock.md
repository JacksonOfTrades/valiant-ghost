Chris Penner,

> People begin to type without knowing that Caps-lock is engaged and after writing one or two lines they notice that they've been yelling the whole time. They must then delete the whole thing because for some reason there's STILL no easy way to switch cases on already typed text in most editors.

For reference, I've removed the caps lock key from my keyboard (Ed. ripped it out with a kitchen knife) for the exact same yelling reason, and I haven't regretted it once.
