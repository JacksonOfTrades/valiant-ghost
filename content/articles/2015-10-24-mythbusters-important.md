Christopher Bonanos on The Vulture:
 
 > <p>After 14 seasons, <i>MythBusters &mdash; </i>Discovery's pop-science engineering-fest, devoted to testing whether various widely held beliefs about the physical world are bogus &mdash; has confirmed <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/mythbusters-ending-after-next-season.html">that the show will go off the air in an explosive fireball after next season</a>. Ratings have dipped, and even fans acknowledged the show was losing steam. Still, it&rsquo;s news that makes you think about the cultural shift since 2001, and how the show&rsquo;s hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman took part in that change. Over the course of nearly 3,000 myths, Savage and Hyneman (joined for much of the run by a trio of hosts doing secondary myths) can be credited with reviving a particular role: that of the public advocate for science and engineering.</p>
