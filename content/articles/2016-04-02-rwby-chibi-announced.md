Roosterteeth today announced a more cute approach to it's popular [RWBY animated series](http://roosterteeth.com/show/rwby), RWBY Chibi, scheduled for release in May 2016! And before you start saying it's an April Fools hoax, this is Roosterteeth's anniversary and for that reason never do a hoax. This is legit.

And as for why, probably not just to get more money from a popular franchise, but RWBY Season 3 took RWBY in a much more [dark and edgy](http://roosterteeth.com/post/51193367) direction. And Roosterteeth no doubt still want the fun and bubbly nature that originally attracted younger viewers to the show in the first season. So why not make a cute, kawaii show just for them? And also, the older people who can't get enough RWBY.

At least, I'm assuming. Some of the more violent elements of last season would be... interesting to see in chibi form.
