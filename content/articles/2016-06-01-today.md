Stand outside waiting for morning classes to start. Every breath turns to frost as soon as it leaves my mouth. 12 degrees Celsius. The only thing keeping the cold at bay is my thin school jacket and thick school jumper. Getting a drink from the tap is like drinking ice itself. Struggle with an internal conflict, read *The Rum Diary* or plunge my hands into my pockets and keep warm. Instead pull out my phone and start writing, even if it hurts my fingers.
