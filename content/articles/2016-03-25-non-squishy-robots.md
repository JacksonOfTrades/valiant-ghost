Adrienne LaFrance, *The Atlantic*:

> Soft robots can often do things that hard robots can’t. They can [grip](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/meet-the-robot-champion-of-beer-pong/384285/), [jump](http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpressrelease/207/a-jump-for-softbodied-robots), and [snake](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/images/5/5f/marchese2014whole.pdf) through narrow spaces in unique ways. This doesn’t mean soft robots will make hard robots obsolete. Many tasks require more durable robots. It just means that humans will be able to interact more safely with pillowy robots—whether the machines are designed to be companions or caretakers. If an inflatable robot accidentally smacks a person in the face, for example, they probably won’t be seriously injured.

Let's be honest, we all want our own cuddly pillow robot who on top of being one of the most badass teddy bears after a scary movie, can also bring us coffee if we want.
