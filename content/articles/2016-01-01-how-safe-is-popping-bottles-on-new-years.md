Of course, with the very later of you getting ready for it to turn to 2016, you may turn to the good old sport of Popping Bottles of champagne to celebrate. And of course it's an old cliché that a popped cork could potentially be a very dangerous weapon in the hands of an unskilled user. But just how dangerous?

> You’ve probably heard the warnings every year come December 31. If your New Year’s Eve plans include shaking up a bottle of champagne, popping the cork with two thumbs, and blasting the wine over a crowd of people in a vaguely pornographic spray of foam, you might want to reconsider. It could quite literally take your eye out.

It's not hard to see how a flying cork could remove your eye, given the physics behind it:

> Your average bottle of champagne holds 6.2 bar (about 90 psi) of pressure, about three times the pressure in a car tire and enough of a punch to fire the cork 42 feet, according to the study. That’s not something you want coming at your face from a few inches away.
