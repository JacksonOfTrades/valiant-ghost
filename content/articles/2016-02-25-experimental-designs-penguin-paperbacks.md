London based designer David Pearon has put together a collection of the original experimental designs of Penguin's popular paperbacks originally created by designer Jan Tschichold. They all kept a very similar design pattern, colored border and a white center with the title in a sans serif font.

As a voracious reader, I consume the relatively cheap Penguin paperbacks like crazy. I'm glad they went for the current design as opposed to the others. Its a design of simplicity and vibrancy, when you are looking in a bookstore you can know instantly if a books a penguin book by the bold familiarity that its current look establishes.
