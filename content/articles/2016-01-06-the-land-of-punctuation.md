Maria Popova, Brain Pickings discusses the poem turned into typographic art 'In The Land of Punctuation' : 

> The great German philosopher, sociologist, and music theorist Theodor Adorno considered punctuation marks the [“friendly spirits whose bodiless presence nourishes the body of language.”](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/11/theodor-adorno-punctuation-marks/) Beloved poet Mary Oliver jested that [every writer has a finite lifetime quota of punctuation](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/10/mary-oliver-on-punctuation/). But there is no more marvelous a celebration of these friendly spirits than [**In the Land of Punctuation**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9383145153/braipick-20) ([*public library*](http://www.worldcat.org/title/in-the-land-of-punctu-atio-n/oclc/319492785&referer=brief_results)) — a beautiful and clever type-art adaptation of German poet Christian Morgenstern’s darkly delightful 1905 poem “Im Reich der Interpunktionen,” illustrated by Indian graphic artist Rathna Ramanathan and translated into English by Sirish Rao.

It's a cool little book, more a work of art than anything else.
