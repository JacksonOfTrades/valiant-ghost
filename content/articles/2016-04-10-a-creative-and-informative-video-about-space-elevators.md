Ah yes, space elevators. Ever since I started playing Halo 2 I have marveled at space elevators, funneling something off from earth surface into space without a rocket. But I've always wondered how they actually work, the physics but more importantly the economics of it. But more importantly, what's wrong with plain old rockets? 

Well, as always, turns out theres a video for that.
