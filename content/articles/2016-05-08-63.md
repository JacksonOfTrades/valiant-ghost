Just a 10 second glance at [Gravity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and I'm reminded of how stupid a movie is, to the point I'm amazed it won so many awards - It's effectively a movie about Sandra Bullock frolicking around in space for a few hours. At the very end I was hoping the character would die, burning up in the atmosphere or drowning. 

Not because I wanted to see her die, but because the movie was so boring and monotonous that seeing that would at least leave an aftertaste that's not so bland.
