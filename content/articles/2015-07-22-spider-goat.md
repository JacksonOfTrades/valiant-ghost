ABC News, 

>In the latest issue of Science, the researchers report that they've managed to successfully create artificial spider silk that's nearly as good as the real thing â€” and without involving a single spider.

>How? Turner and his team of bio scientists took the genes responsible for creating spider silk into the cells of mammals, such as goats. Using those genes, the re-engineered goats were then able to produce in their milk the same protein that makes up spider's silk.

A glass of spider milk anyone?
