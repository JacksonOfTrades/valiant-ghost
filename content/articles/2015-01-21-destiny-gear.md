>  Destiny gets a lot right when it comes to loot and gear, but suffers from severe problems as well.

This is the main thing I hear the most about Destiny. I haven't played it (yet) but from what I hear, its a game people love and hate. Its gets the gear right, which is important. Theres always something that pulls people back in, usually with the gear, or tasks, which is getting an online game right. But they also screwed it in that it was not the glorious game they wanted [^1].

[^1]: This goes to show how good marketing can be when selling a game.
