> When we think of novels, of newspapers and blogs, we think of words. We easily forget the little suggestions pushed in between: the punctuation. But how can we be so cruel to such a fundamental part of writing?


> Inspired [by a series of posters](http://www.c82.net/work/?id=347), I wondered what did my favorite books look like without words. Can you tell them apart or are they all a-mush? In fact, they can be *quite* distinct. 

Cool, although I highly doubt people will be following the puncuation of how I write on this site.
