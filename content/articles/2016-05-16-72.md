"And like the Fist of God the drum beat of thunder rolled across the small town with each strike."



*There's a pretty heavy thunder/rainstorm here, and I'm listening to the sound of thunder while I write this and try to figure out if there's a way to get [iA Writer on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ia.iawriter) to save files in Dropbox for offline use. Would be really handy, and would give it a major advantage over [Jotterpad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x) as my mobile writing app.*
