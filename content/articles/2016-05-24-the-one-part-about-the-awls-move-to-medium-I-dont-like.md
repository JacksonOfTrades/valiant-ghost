[The Awl](https://theawl.com/) has completed their [long foretold](http://valiantghost.com/2016/04/the-awl-moves-to-medium/) move to [Medium](https://theawl.com/awl-polished-1dbb24daaf25). I wrote a [microblog post](https://valiantghost.com/2016/05/76/) about it a few minutes ago, writing about how it just looks like a slightly different version of the theme all writing on Medium has.

Upon completing this post, I took the inevitable walk into my RSS feed to sort through the daily news. And then I came across another part of the change I didn't like. The RSS feed. 

It's one of those RSS feeds all Medium blogs have, the cutoff section - *Click here to continue reading the article*. 

For nearly all of it, I wouldn't mind, as the Awl writes a fair bit of long form stuff. But The Awl's also write's a daily review of the weather in New York and Alex Balk has taken to writing shorter linkblog posts lately, most of which I prefer to read in the RSS feed given their shortness.

I don't like the new change of the Awl to Medium, however, I could sit with the new design so long as the content stayed the same. But this, this takes the cake, I don't like it.
