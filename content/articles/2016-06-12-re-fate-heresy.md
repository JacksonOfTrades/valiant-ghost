*Replying to my own post. Is this a thing people do? Surely I could just go back and edit it, but I feel the idea I have is strong enough that it should be repeated here.*

In my previous post titled [Fate/Heresy](https://valiantghost.com/2016/06/fate-heresy/) I suggested a rather odd[^1] viewing order of the fate anime: Fate Unlimited Blade Works Season 1, Fate/Zero, Fate/Unlimited Blade Works Season 2.  At the time the main reason I cited was Gilgamesh and exlaination of his motives. However I did muss a rather important characteristic to the whole story: Kiritsugu.



Ultimately the thing I love about Zero over Unlimited Blade Works is the tragic story of Kiritsugu, how in his quest to salvation he was ultimatly brought ruin. By watching UBW first you know at least that Kiritsugu is dead jealous 

[^1]: Or heretical, depending on your view.
