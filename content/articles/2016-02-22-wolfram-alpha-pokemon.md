I've recently got back into Pokemon[^1] which of course means I'm right back into breeding my Pokemon party for a competitive battle. While trying to remember the movesets[^2] I allocated about a year/two years ago in Pokemon X, I stumbled across a neat little feature of computational knowledge engine [WolfRam Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/). It can act as a PokeDex, giving us stats on any Pokemon we put in. For example, typing in [```pokemon Zoroark```](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Pokemon+Zoroark)[^3] gives us this:

Scrolling down gives us the base stats of a Pokemon, but then we come to my favorite part...

![Zoroark curves](/images/zoroarkcurves1.png){: .small }

It has curves! No, not those curves, but math curves! Clicking on the image takes you to a page... with a hell of a lot of math to generate a curve similar to the shape of a Zoroark on a calculator.

It's possible to even compare the stats of Pokemon. In my case it will be Latios and Latias:

From this I can clearly see that Latios has a slightly higher attack while Latias has a slightly higher defence. Awesome.

Another awesome example would be typing in [```best Pokemon for special attack```](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Best+Pokemon+for+Special+Attack) which gives me Mega Mewtwo Y. You can do this for any Pokemon. For example Mega Rayquazza is considered the best pokemon for all around stats while Eevee is considered the best starter. 

Its important to note that in its stat calculations for best Pokemon, it is simply doing what WolfRam Alpha does best, numbers. It's adding up the stats to produce the best number and give it to you. Eevee, for example, is considered the best starter Pokemon but only due to its stats, not the moves it can learn  or anything else relating to that. If you do want a moveset, I would consider googling/Duck Duck Go-ing ```[Pokemon Name] Moveset``` and seeing what you find. But for fun and basic stat comparison, it's a nice little addition.

Especially for those curves...
