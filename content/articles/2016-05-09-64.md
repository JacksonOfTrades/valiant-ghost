**CHAIKA SPOILERS**: I've been gathering ideas and references for an essay on [Chaika: The Coffin Princess](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20853/Hitsugi_no_Chaika) I plan to write, so I of course turned to TV Tropes. Turns out that Chaika can speak fluently the language of the Gaz Empire, Laake, but struggles with the common language. Toru can speak Laake fine, but she prefers to speak in common. My theory as to why she speaks common is when she was 'reprogrammed' as Chaika Trabant she was encoded with the desire to speak common, rather than Laake, so she could blend in better and recruit people to her cause easier. But some Chaika's speak English in the non-broken way unlike Chaika. I have no explanation for them.
