Yay! Another monthly thing. Typically I suck at these but I've been meaning to do something like this for a while. 

Each column/post/thing will generally work in this format, a brief blurb from me about it, a rating and then maybe a link to Amazon if that’s where I bought it from. Granted, I read a lot of my books physical so this might not be often.

### A Blink of the Screen

#### By Terry Pratchett

Collected shorter fiction by Terry Pratchett, from his first published work when he was 13(!) to some of his more recent things and even some Discworld shorter fiction. A good book.

As you would expect from a collected fiction piece, some works are better than others but its still a good read.

Rating: 3/5

### Hogfather

#### By Terry Pratchett

More Terry Pratchett, but I like the bloke. I bought and read this because: 

1. The Discworld movie based on this novel was my first taste of Terry Pratchett. I remember it was on Christmas Eve years ago. My parents thought it was weird but I thought it was awesome, dwarevs, Assassins breaking into the Tooth Fairies castle, Death being Santa and all things like that. I absolutely loved it.
2. It’s nearly Christmas, so I thought may as well read it to *try* and get in the spirit.

Like all Discworld novels, it’s an absolute charm to read.

Rating: 5/5



### Otaku Journalism

#### By Lauren Orsini

You may have noticed a recent influx of anime related things on this site. This is because of Orsini's site [Otaku Journalist](http://otakujournalist.com/) and this book. I actually found the book and the site by accident while looking for a way to write an auto-tweeting bot. The writing on the site was good enough so I thought the book would be good too. 

So blame her for the recent influx of anime based things.

Valiant Ghost is best described as 'Things that interest me'. Anime interests me so its going on here.

Rating: 5/5

### Random Abnormality (Twisted Fates book 1)

#### By Sam Ashcraft

I originally wasn't going to pick up this book but the premise looked interesting enough, like Underworld if Underworld was more modern about itself. A decent book, it has a few grammar errors but the plot is interesting. Note: plot gets all over the place but fits the overall story of the book.

Rating: 4/5

### Build Your Anime Blog

#### By Lauren Orsini

More Anime stuff! Also by Orsini, but it’s given me more insight into anime journalism, which is kind of something I'd like to write about here.

My only complaint is the second part of the book is all interviews with other anime bloggers, which is nice but I'd have liked more writing from Orsini herself.

4/5

### Dracula

#### By Bram Stoker

While the above list may not seem like it, I read *a lot* of classical fiction, to the point I'm made fun of it sometimes. I've been meaning to buy this book for a while, but watching Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate finally sealed the deal on my purchase of this.

I've only just started on it, but I'm 100 pages or so in. It's told in a series of journal entries, which gives it a different feel then from most first person fiction I've read. A good read.

Rating: none (I haven't finished it yet, so it feels mean to give it a rating without evaluating the whole book).
