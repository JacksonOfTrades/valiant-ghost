On July 1st, the 13 year old Planetside 1 shut down. My only foray into the world of Planetside was with the second game realeased in 2012[^1], which was basically the death of the original game.

It always saddens me to see news like this, that a game just ends because the developers can no longer keep a server up. I of course understand why, money and all that, but the fact there is no 'archive' for games, so that we can keep playing them after the dev's bring the server down, is something that needs to change soon. 



[^1]: And of course, being the newbie I was to PC gaming, I played with my laptop touchpad.
