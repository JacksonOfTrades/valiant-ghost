>The Henn-na Hotel's blinking and "breathing" actroids will be able to make eye contact, respond to body language, and speak fluent Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English, The Washington Post reports. They will check-in guests, carry bags, make coffee, clean rooms, and deliver laundry.
The robot staff will be supplemented with a human staff...for now. At a news conference in Japan, Huis Ten Bosch president Hideo Sawada said, "In the future, weâ€™d like to have more than 90 percent of hotel services operated by robots."

Combined with the news on the [skiing robot](http://gizmodo.com/oh-great-the-robots-can-ski-now-1684419661), good luck during the Robopocalypse.
