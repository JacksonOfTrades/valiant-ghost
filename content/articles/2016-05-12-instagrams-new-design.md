![The New Design](/images/thenewgram.jpg)

Today, Instagram has [changed their UI to a monochrome color scheme and their logo to a gradiant](http://blog.instagram.com/post/144198429587/160511-a-new-look):

> Today we’re introducing a new look. You’ll see an updated icon and app design for Instagram. Inspired by the previous app icon, the new one represents a simpler camera and the rainbow lives on in gradient form.



> [...]



> We’ve made improvements to how the Instagram app looks on the inside as well. The simpler design puts more focus on your photos and videos without changing how you navigate the app. 

I'm personally not a big fan of this change, I like both the color scheme of the old design, a blue header, white body and a black bar along the bottom[^1]. 

I also thoroughly dislike the new logo. When Instagram was, against all the odds, the only app that didn't adopt a flat design and kept with the pop-up design, I admired it for its uniqueness. The old icon had charm, you could find it easily, as [Tim Nudd writes](http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/instagrams-new-logo-travesty-can-we-change-it-back-please-171398):



> Unfortunately, while it may render better in some environments, it's a very forgettable image that will get lost on people's phones amid the thousands of other similarly uninspired designs of most tech apps. It's a bit baffling how this is considered an improvement—indeed, why they felt there was a need to "modernize" at all.



It's still a camera, but I liked the old hipster polaroid to the new minimalist white camera on a fugly gradient background.

Plus the UI now just looks like [Ello](https://valiantghost.com/2014/10/Ello/), which has a design I hate. If I never liked the monochrome design of a social network I never use, then I sure as hell don't like the new design of a social network I use almost every day.

I guess for once, having your phone so full you can't download new updates has saved me.
