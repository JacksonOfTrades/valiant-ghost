Sebastian Anthony, *Ars Technica*:

> Way back in the autumn of 2004, I may have invented the world's first GPS-based augmented reality game. In light of the stratospheric success of *Pokémon Go*, I'm wondering whether I should have perhaps attempted to patent my invention.

I really would've loved this game. Pokemon Go is fun and all, but I love MUD's and Dwarves way more than Pokémon.
