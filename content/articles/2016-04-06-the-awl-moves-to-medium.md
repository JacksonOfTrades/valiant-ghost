As I'm sure you've read by now, [The Awl](http://www.theawl.com/2016/04/i-also-could-have-gone-with-medium-cool) is moving to from Wordpress to Medium's new [publishing platform](https://medium.com/the-story/making-medium-more-powerful-for-publishers-39663413a904#.oplnm1aaj) and so are a [bunch of other sites](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11362398/medium-for-publishers-the-awl-bill-simmons-the-ringer). I don't really like this instantly but I'll see how it goes. The content model for this new Wordpress alternative is an ad-less network with a [DF](http://daringfireball.net/) style paid content promotion system. My main problem with this is that from what I've seen every site will look Medium-y, no original design or anything, I quite like the Awls design, Some inspiration of my inspiration for the design of this site came from The Awl[^1]. 

Medium's design was cool at first but now its all... samey. For some reason, I associate a weblogs design with the 'voice' of a writer along with the writing.  I liked how jumping between the different weblogs of bloggers I liked all *looked different.* And Medium is just the same design over and over for every post. Sure,  the new platform allows for a different logo and different colors, but all the same Medium-y look.

 Anyway, I'll see how this goes. I trust The Awl not to mess up.

There is something I just thought of as I was about to publish this post, [ads and ad blocking](http://valiantghost.com/2015/10/on-ads/). I may be one of the few who doesn't mind ads. Because my main problem with blocking ads is it stops actually good publications and blogs, like The Awl, from getting paid because people don't want to look at bad ads. As Medium is sans ads but with their new paid content promotion system, this could be the way out. Or as John Gruber said [back during the iOS 9 ad blocking scadel](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/16/because-of-apple):

> Perhaps I am being smug. But I see the fact that Daring Fireball’s revenue streams should remain unaffected by Safari content-blocking as affirmation that my choices over the last decade have been correct: that I should put my readers’ interests first, and only publish the sort of ads and sponsorships that I myself would want to be served, even if that means leaving (significant) amounts of money on the table along the way. But I take no joy in the fact that a terrific publication like The Awl might be facing hard times. They’re smart; they will adapt.

They adapted.
