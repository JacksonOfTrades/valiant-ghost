*Chaika Spoilers:* Just realised something, Vivi is often called a 'Half-Chaika' and that her transformation into a Chaika was only half complete. But what does that even mean? Considering what we know about the Chaika's how does being half-Chaika work? How was she normal and then suddenly transformed into a Chaika? It's never explained, and a rather glaring hole in the plot.
