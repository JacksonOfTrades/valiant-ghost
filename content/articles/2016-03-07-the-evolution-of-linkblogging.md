> In my posts about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">defining what makes a microblog post</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">guidelines for RSS</a>, I talked a little about links but didnâ€™t explore linkblogging. While many blog authors post primarily long essays, shorter link blogs are a common approach for bloggers who want to post new content several times a day.

It is also for people like me, who are lazy and the linkblog provides an easy way to blog without having to write a couple hundred words. Short and easy, write as little as I like or as much as I like.
