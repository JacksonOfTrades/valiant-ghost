title: Man Up!  The book that is (now) always with me

As a rule, I'm generally not a outdoorsy person. A good weekend for me is a cup of coffee, a good book/column/link to write for Valiant Ghost/website to design, and sunny weather to do some washing with.

That being said, I do go outside when necessary, to eat or when it's socially acceptable. I will also rarely venture out if I think I could get a good photograph.

There is no substitute to good lessons and experience for outdoor scenarios, but for me the book Man Up! by Rod Green is what can probably make sure I know what to do in a survival situation, or any situation where I'm outside and don't know what to do. This handy and comical guide is the best tool any man, even the non-outdoorsy like me, can have. It covers how to snare and cook a rabbit, how to tickle trout, how to land a light aircraft, how to construct a lean to for the night, how to darn a sock and even how to dress fashionably and effectively. It's more comical then your average survival guide.

You can pick Man Up! up from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Man-Up-Real-Manly-Knowledge/dp/178243030X), [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Rod_Green_Man_Up?id=WhXdAgAAQBAJ&hl=en) and probably at a local book shop or library. (I got mine from a hospice shop for 85 pence).
