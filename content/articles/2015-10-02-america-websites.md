There is now an official American way to make websites 

> Open source UI components and visual style guide to create consistency and beautiful user experiences across U.S. federal government websites

Looking through the documentation, it is rather well written, although it does get very American at time [^1] I will certainly be applying some of these principals (like the fonts) on this website.

Edit: After looking through the code, it's not just a way to design websites the american way, its an America web design framework, along the lines of Bootstrap or Foundation 5.

[^1]: From the docs: "This palette is designed to support a range of distinct visual styles that continue to feel connected. The intent of the palette is to convey a warm and open American spirit, with bright saturated tints of blue and red, grounded in sophisticated deeper shades of cool blues and grays. These colors — combined with clear hierarchy, good information design, and ample white space — should leave users feeling welcomed and in good hands."
