Pingdom compared the performance of the top 50 blogs in 2015 to see how their speed results stacked up

> What are blogs, and shouldn’t they be called publications? The line is blurry, and most listings of big blogs have **Huffington Post** in its top-3, and if that’s okay then surely other aggregated sites, like **Medium**, could be considered blogs as well.

> Publication or blog, let’s focus on what we do know: Web performance. You can read about the methodology of the tests below.

> As expected, performance among these top 50 publications is quite the mix. There are sites that are small, fast, big, large, and everything in between. We have all the numbers and charts for you.

> Let’s start with the size of each site’s homepage. The average page size of the top 50 blogs was 4.82 MB. This is an increase from the average 2.10 MB homepage size we found when we studied the top 100 blogs in 2012. It’s also a big jump from the 934 kB in average size [we found in 2008](http://royal.pingdom.com/2008/11/05/load-size-analysis-of-the-top-100-blogs/).

Interesting to see how the average page size has spiked in the past couple of years. I honestly wonder why this is, due to the increase in [advertisement size](/2015/11/advertising/) or just that images have become better quality over the past couple of years. Also disappointed that [Kottke.org](http://kottke.org), [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net), [Zeldman.com](https://zeldman.com) and similar blogs like that weren't in the list.
