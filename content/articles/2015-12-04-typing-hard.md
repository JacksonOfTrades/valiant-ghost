There are two keyboard layouts I know off by heart, my laptops inbuilt keyboard and my 'Stealth Keyboard' as I call it. My laptop is a 15" Asus laptop and my Stealth Keyboard[^1] is, if I had to guess, 17" wide. Obviously, as the Stealth Keyboard has more space the keys are larger and produce less of a sound when I hit the keys, hence the name. But I was kind of curious as to whether I typed *faster* on my laptops inbuilt keyboard compared to my Stealth Keyboard, which I had been using  exclusively for nearly two years at this point, due to smaller size of the inbuilt keyboard.

Firstly, I type hard. I've been told many times that I hit the spacebar too hard and that my typing sounds way louder than it needs to be. And this has some merit to it, I smash the spacebar down way to hard, more than I probably need to. Its habit. 

What prompted me to replace my keyboard was this; I can remember fondly when I didn't use the stealth keyboard due to the fact I had just moved and didn't have a desk yet. It was also around this time I tried, again, to write a novel. Of course my attempts failed, but I can remember that at the time I was trying out some text expansion software at the time and I had somehow lost an entire chapter. So, knowing exactly what to write I got straight back to it. According to my text expansion software, my average words per minute count was ~120. This did not surprise me in the slightest. My family has massive, slender pianist hands and my great grandmother was Personal Private Stenographer, who could apparently type on a typewriter at 160 wpm. However, only a few days ago when I checked on my Stealth Keyboard my wpm count, it was in fact only 80! I checked again with my laptop keyboard, and it’s around the same.

I also notice I make more mistakes on my laptop keyboard. Maybe it’s just because of disuse my knowledge of the keys has atrophied, or maybe I'm wrong when I think that the smaller keyboard allows me to type faster. Maybe it does, but due to the small size my massive hands make more mistakes, compared to writing slower with fewer mistakes. Typing just this paragraph had a slew of errors in it, many annoying ones too. Sure, I only had to go back a word and delete it, buts its still annoying.

So what do I take from this? Maybe I've slowed down. Maybe when writing speed challenges I am less enthusiastic about what I write, and therefore write slower. Maybe when I tried writing the novel I was so enthusiastic about it that my hands moved faster. 

But, here’s an advantage to having to using the laptop keyboard compared to my Stealth Keyboard. I have more room on my desk. Granted, this makes the screen closer to me as well, but I quite like it. I have more room behind my computer to throw my stuff[^2].

Overall, I do prefer the smaller keyboard. Having to only memorise one keyboard keys position is probably a better idea compared to having one 'home' and one 'out' structure. The added space is also a plus.


[^1]: Which is actually a Logitech keyboard, and while I don't remember the name I do remember the fact that it has advertised 'super quiet keys'. So, it is now my Stealth Keyboard.
