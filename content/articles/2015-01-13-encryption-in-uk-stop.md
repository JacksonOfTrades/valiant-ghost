Interesting when you realise iMessage uses End to End encryption, which essentially means the service could be cut off in the UK if this passes through. A lot of people rely on iMessage, Whatsapp and the such to send messages, myself included. iPhones and Nexus phones are also encrypted by default, so would that also lead to them being banned?

Ultimately, the worst that could happen is something similar to China taking place[^1], where all services are cut off except the ones deemed 'safe' by the seemingly technologically ignorant government.
