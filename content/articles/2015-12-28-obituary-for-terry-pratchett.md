Rhianna Pratchett, daughter of Terry, writing on the Guardian:

> My father talked about death a lot. He believed that we should be more like our Victorian forebears who, although rather bashful when it came to talking about sex, regarded death as a much more comfortable topic of conversation. It’s the great unifier. No matter who you are, one day the reaper will come for you.


> The reaper came for my father much earlier in his life in the form of Death from his world-famous and much-loved Discworld novels. Death was a towering, cloaked and scythe-wielding skeleton who had a penchant for curries, a love of cats and TALKED LIKE THIS. We got a number of tear-inducing letters from fans who were nearing the end of their lives and took great comfort in imagining that the death that came for them would be riding a white horse called Binky. Dad had done something with more success than anyone else – he made Death friendly.

I just finished Terry's autobiography, *A Slip of the Keyboard* and a lot of what Rhianna writes here rings true to what I read in that book, in Terry's own words.

I loved Terry Pratchett, he is one of my favorite authors, even after his death this still rings true. As a fan I could write about him on length, but for now I will leave one little snippet. Today I finished *The Long Earth*, which Pratchett co-published with Stephen Baxter. It's great, solid science fiction and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. 

One day I may put a list of my favorite Discworld books up on here. They're good books, you should read them if you haven't already.
