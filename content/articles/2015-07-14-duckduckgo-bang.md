What, you may ask, is this lovely feature? For current users , simply type ```!bang``` into the search box and you will be told all about it. For those who don't, as always the title links to the page. 

I tested it out, typing ```!reddit Hello``` into the search box, and after a brief wait took me straight to a reddit search for hello. Looking through the list there's so many sites that you can use! There's [Voat](https://voat.co/), [Batoto](http://bato.to/), [Wookiepedia](http://starwars.wikia.com/) and even !df for [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/).
