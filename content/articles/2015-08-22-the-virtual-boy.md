> Twenty years ago, on August 21, 1995, Nintendo released the Virtual Boy in North America. The stilt-legged tabletop gaming console, which offered a unique red stereoscopic 3D display, attempted to ride a wave of popular interest in virtual reality. It was a risky, innovative gamble for Nintendo that didn't pay off, leaving many to wonder why it existed in the first place.

The Nintendo Virtual Boy - It didn't exactly reinvent the wheel the way it wanted to, more it laid the groundwork for more successful VR technologies like Oculus Rift and Microsoft Hololens. If you have the time, the linked article is a lovely read if you care about gaming history.
