I use [Discord](https://discordapp.com) on an almost daily basis to be involved in a number of communities, mostly gaming related. But I have found [some](https://discord.gg/0nB4KX4Nt72rLeDo) that are [not gaming related](https://discord.gg/0XFgqDP4dR4jS6iq). And I also found a significant lack of communities related to web design and development, one of my interests. 

So I [made my own](https://discord.gg/0rKrExDiPWE0pSV2). Of course, [Slack](https://slack.com/) would be a better idea for something like this but as I use Discord every day and Slack almost never this seemed like a better solution. If you too use Discord and want to discuss web design and development, come along. It'll be fun.
