I recently finished Harper Lee's second book, *Go Set a Watchman*, the sequel to *To Kill a Mockingbird*[^1] and at the very back of the book is  page on the font used throughout the book. It reads:

<center> 

<blockquote> A NOTE ON THE TYPE </blockquote>

</center>

> This book was set in Fournier, one of the earliest examples of transitional font based on the type cut by Augustin Ordinaire, by the innovating French engraver Pierre Simon Fournier, circa 1742. Transitional-style faces were the inspiration for the modern style made popular by Giambattista Bodoni later in the century.

> Fournier (September 15, 1712-October 8, 1768) made numerous contributions to the field of type design - notably his creating of initials and ornaments; his standardization of type sizes; and his development of a new musical-type style, with elegant, rounded notes that made reading music easier

> The Fournier font is a distinguished roman face - almost modern in character - with an elegant French-inspired *italic* that produces an open, pristine setting that is both stylish and friendly.

It's an odd but nice addition to the book. For the most part I thought it was set in Georgia, but going back and comparing the fonts makes some differences obvious. Georgia bends more , while  Fournier is more flat.

[^1]: I just realised how similar those titles are.
