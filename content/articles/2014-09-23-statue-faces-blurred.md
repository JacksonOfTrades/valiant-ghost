You know what Google street view is, right? Its how you can click on a street and see what it looks like. It has a function to protect privacy where it blurs out faces, which is a smart move.

And it is also performing the face blurring magic with the faces of statues. Yep, so Buddha's, Sphinx's and all kinds of statues are being blurred by google's street view.

I'm not sure whether this is funny or just strange. But I don't think its that easy for a computer to tell the difference between a statue face and a real face.

There's also some quote about blurring the face of a god that I'm too lazy to find.

Edit: Found it! Not quite what I wanted, but take what you can get.
