I liked it. As opposed to a more family friendly version of RWBY as I thought it would be, it is instead comedic short adventures featuring the RWBY cast, similar to those short cartoons in between the longer ones you sometimes used to get. It's got the cute Chibi style and minimal dialogue, fitting the description  perfectly.
