*Welcome to* The Right Tool For The Job *a column series where I attempt to give a highly objective analysis and review of a weapon from an anime series, eventually leading up to the question of whether I myself would use it.*

Some may call what I'm doing here cheating, but I think otherwise. By picking a weapon from Akame Ga Kill as my object of review this week, I technically have 40 or so weapons to pick from. I could of course give a brief overview of the weapons presented, but thats not fun. And my choice may be unorthodox to begin with, as Incursio is not necessarily a weapon. It is armor... But as the old proverb goes, *the best offence is a good defence.*

Incursio is the Imperial Arms[^1] of Bulat and later of Tatsumi. In its inactive form Incursio takes the form of a short sword with a keyblade like chain on the end. When it's used - Which is by stabbing the sword into the ground and screaming *"INCURSIO!"* - causing the all powerful armor to form around the user. Due to its high power, any user of Incursio is practically invulnerable to all non-Imperial Arms related damage.

### Living, breathing armor

A rather interesting fact is that the armor is *alive*. Rather than just being a magical suit of armor crafted in whatever way by whatever smith, Incursio was created from from the skin of the Danger Beat Tyrant, a dragon who's form could shift depending on where he is. Tundra, he got that. Desert, he got that. They somehow converted a living thing into armor, so much so that Incursio keeps its evolving abilities to this day. When it went from Bulat to Tatsumi the armor is converted depending on how his user fights, changing from Bulat's heavy form and fighting style to the slimmer Tatsumi's more athletic style of combat. 

Incursio does come with a weapon beyond the hitting power of its fists, Neuntote - literally meaning nine dead people in German - a spear summonable when Incursio is activated. It's known as It's never explained how Tyrant's abilites allowed it to summon the spear Neuntote, which is rather disappointing. Why not summon a sword, or an axe? 

Due to Tyrant's abilities, it seems strange that Incursio only evolves once more throughout the entire series. And while it was both a significant boost in terms of both power and style[^2] that is about it. If used better it could be a rather intersting dynamic. I would've loved to have seen Incursio evolve when Night Raid went to the desert to fit the enviroment, but alas my hopes were in vain as it stayed the exact same. You could argue that the armor doesn't really need to evolve any more than it does, but an added sombrero would be an addition which you could not top.

One thing I really don't like? [The Cape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R2aW03pwL0). I have never likes capes unless they have the dual use of being a cloak - protection from the elements and all that. On any superhero or armor they are purely aesthetic for blowing in the wind dramatically. Incursio is designed to be used in close quarter combat situations and a cape would just be a detriment.  It would get in the way of your blows, your legs would be tangled in it, it could get in your eyes. 

### Incursio V2

so logically I would love a version of Incursio without the cape and that is just what Incursion V2 is. Okay, so that's not it's real name - Grand Chariot is the name of Incursio V2 - but it is obviously a better Incursio. It's wielded by Wave, the bad but not that bad Tatsumi and comes in everyones favorite color: black.

### Would I use it.

Da da da... no. But just like Crescent Rose it's not because I dislike Incursio, but rather that I don't want to die. As Bulat explains to Tatsumi when he passes the armor down there is a chance that Incursio will kill the user for reasons involving how cool you think it is. And while an increase in speed and strength would be cool, the amount of times I need it in my daily life would not be worth risking my l
