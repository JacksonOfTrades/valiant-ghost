For Christmas (2015) I got a new lens for my camera, the Canon 50mm STM f/1.8. And let me say it now, it’s a bloody good lens. Maybe it’s not for a landscape photographer, but it works just fine for me taking pictures of my family and cows. However I've been somewhat neglecting it for my older 55-250mm lens, just because it’s a more versatile lens. 

Inspired by [this Brooks Review post](https://brooksreview.net/2015/11/35mm/) I'm now going to try something a little different. I'm currently writing this at 34000ft/10365m above the ground[^1] on my way to Tasmania to see some of my family over there. I bought my camera with me, but only my 50mm lens. My 55-250mm is very, very far away from me. 

Edit: Due to power errors on my laptops battery this wasn't published until the 9th, while this was written on the 8th, at ground level. I've got to say, so far the experiments going well. The photos I've produced have been pretty nice.
