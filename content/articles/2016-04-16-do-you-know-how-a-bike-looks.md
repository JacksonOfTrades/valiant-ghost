Back in 2009 Italian designer Gianluca Gimini pestered a bunch of people on the street to draw him what a bicycle looked like, and when put on the spot most people couldn't even begin to imagine what a bike looked like. And seven years later he made the zany sketches into some truly zany and wonderful designs.

And despite having spent two hours cleaning out a garage filled with bikes before I read this, even I somewhat suffered to remember the slightly ubiquitous shape of a bike.
