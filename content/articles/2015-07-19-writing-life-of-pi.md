Yann Martel (Yes, its written by the guy who wrote the actual book):

>I would guess that most books come from the same mix of three elements: influence, inspiration and hard work. Let me detail how each one came into play in the writing of [Life of Pi](http://www.powells.com/biblio/2-9780156027328-25).

It's quite an interesting read, and I don't usually like things like these. But there's something about this one I just love.
