I'm not quite sold on this new coffee fad *juuuuust* yet, but the main advantage seems to be that it has twice the caffeine [^1] and that it removes the bitterness that coffee has. I've tried it, and that last part seems to be bullshit, to me it’s even **more** bitter, especially during the actual drinking of the coffee.

For me, it’s a kind of 'meh' experience. It's alright in its own way but I would not recommend this to any of my friends who like coffee. If you make it right you can remove *some* of the bitterness but not a lot, it’s definitely still there.

Who knows, it might be like [bulletproof coffee](http://www.marco.org/2013/02/12/buttered-coffee); a big thing for a while then we go back to plain old normal coffee, you know, the coffee we've been drinking for ages and it’s been just fine.

Plus who wants to wait a *whole 24 hours* just to drink a cup of coffee.

[^1]: Okay, that’s a  plus.
