I have decided if I had to have a Servant from the Fate/Series it would probably be [Karna](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Karna). As I work  my way through the Fate/Apocrypha fan translation, his personality and power is very endearing. He is straight forward, methodical. A job needs to be done, and he does it. Just like me.
