I am constantly amazed at what people can make with Lego, especially to get such detail as this.

The same photographer has also made some more awesome Discworld Lego creations, including [Susan](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kumipallomaa/21808725266/in/dateposted/) and [Vimes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kumipallomaa/21719775158/in/dateposted/).

Update: The photographer actually has an entire [Lego Discworld album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kumipallomaa/sets/72157651533475121).
