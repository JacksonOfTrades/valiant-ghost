*The below is a footnote from a post about [my Android home screen](https://valiantghost.com/2016/05/my-homescreen/)*



Oh god, including this that’s seven footnotes. SEVEN! Why do I need so many damn footnotes in the first place? Why can’t I be one of those writers whose brain does not go off at tangents and they can fit what they need to say in the main body of the text? I blame Terry Pratchett (RIP), his own style is heavily dependent on footnotes and he’s one of my favorite writers. Or [Gruber over at DF](http://daringfireball.net/) who I also really admired when I started taking web writing seriously.
