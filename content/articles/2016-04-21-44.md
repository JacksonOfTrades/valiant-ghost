My new Fate/Grand Order team:![2016-04-21 08.16.05](/images/fgoparty/2016-04-21.jpg)

An update from last time, everyone has ascended once. I've switched Bonny and Reed and Helena Blavatsky around, and replaced EMIYA with Nero, just for the last minute tank-iness she can provide, at least until I can get EMIYA up to a decent level. And much to my own chagrin I've replaced Jekyll with Beowulf, because he's overall a decent enough Berserker even if he does look like a Jersey Shore Bro.
