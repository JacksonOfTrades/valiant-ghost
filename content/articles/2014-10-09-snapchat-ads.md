Really, is anyone surprised? It had to happen eventually. You don't turn down a billion dollars and expect it all to be okay. Although the opt-out thing is pretty neat.

From what he said, you won't get ads with your <del>nudes</del>[^1] photo's, but with a [Our Story](http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/29/6084221/snapchat-our-story-collective-snaps-from-live-events) function, which is kind of collaborative images.

[^1]: So apparently, slashthrough doesn't work in Kramdown (the version of markdown I use for this blog). So if you see ~~ around a post, assume I'm trying to put a slash through it but its not working.
