I may sound strange in writing this, but I actually like Twitters 140 character limit and *don't want it raised*. The constraints allow for much tighter writing, and it can be fun to see how much you can condense a wordy thought into tweet form.

Unlike this post, where I could go on[^1] Twitter is short, sweet, witty, what you need. And I like it.
