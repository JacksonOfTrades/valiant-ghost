Megan Garber, *The Atlantic*:

>  It’s true. But it’s not just that LOL, the stuff of the Vintage Internet, has gone soft in its old age, suggesting hilarity that is politely introverted rather than raucously audible. It’s more that LOL, at this point, has lost most of its sense of humor. While the term has certainly stopped meaning, literally, “laughing out loud,” it has also ceased to indicate—to a large extent if not the full one—“laughter” of any kind at all.

I never use LOL myself but I have noticed that some of my... less technically inclined members of my family do in fact overuse it at the end of the sentences to the point where they do indeed use LOL as a punctuation mark. I often highly doubt they even gave it more than a short smile.

But what could we change it to? ISAT - I Smiled At That? It's confusing, but at this point we can't really change it. LOL has become so ingrained in our daily casual lingo that it would be impossible to remove it for anything else at this point.
