Elizabeth Preston, writing for *The Atlantic* about the scientists developing Sharkovision:

> Now Gruber, a biologist at the City University of New York’s Baruch College, wants to know why all these species are glowing. He and his colleagues built a “shark-eye” camera to simulate how fluorescent sharks appear to each other, in part so that humans view these creatures a little more kindly.

> Animals like fish and turtles don’t generate their own light, as a firefly does. Being biofluorescent means molecules in their skin absorb light of a certain wavelength, and bounce it back at a different wavelength. In the ocean, that usually means they absorb blue light and transform it into green, red or orange. It’s hard to notice with human eyes in the dim ocean, though a person might detect a greenish cast to a shark’s skin, for example.

And eventually other-ovision as well:

> One of his next steps will be to create cameras representing other animal eyes, thanks to a new technology called a hyperspectral camera. This kind of camera could let researchers record footage underwater, then write algorithms back in the lab to transform the footage into the viewpoint of various species.

I've always had quite an interest in bioluminescence, especially the biology behind the species that actually absorb the light, and for what reason they absorb the light.
