> Fallout 4 recently came out. And right before that, Bethesda released Fallout anthology which came in a mini nuke. I thought this was awesome, but could never bring myself to play older games so I decided to make my own instead. One thatâ€™s closer to the Fallout 4 nuke. And here it is!

Not only is the mini nuke cool in its authenticity, but the details in the internals of the damn thing just make it one of the best prop recreations I've seen for Fallout.
