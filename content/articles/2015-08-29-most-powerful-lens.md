The New York Times,

> It came with a warning: Looking through it would be like looking at the city through a soda straw â€” a traditional soda straw that does not bend like an elbow.

> A $180,000 soda straw.

> The warning applied to a camera lens that is unbelievably large, unbelievably heavy and unbelievably expensive. It is, in order, three feet long, 36 pounds and see above.
