Molly Young, The New York Times:

> Every generation’s fear is that the next generation has found better ways to avoid the risks of being a human. Baby boomers, for one, deem it pathetic that younger people refuse to ask each other out on the phone and do it by text instead; Gen Xers think Millennials are losers for resorting to Tinder instead of spotting a comely stranger and buying that person a beer. This scorn is both deserved and fruitless. In 20 years, texting will look audacious compared to whatever ultra-mediated quasi-contact young people are making.


> Let’s strip away the censure, for a moment, by analogizing the trend to personal wealth management. If we define “capital” in this metaphor as a mixture of our time and emotional stasis, then staying in is the ultimate conservative investment. It’s like pouring your money into a savings account: You’ll grow marginally; you’ll stay safe; your expectations will be met and never exceeded. The worst-case scenario is that your delivery fries are soggy and your premium cable TV episode is a B+ instead of an A. You can always pull the ripcord on your show and go to bed early. A failed night means that you got a good night’s sleep. That’s still a win. A modest win, but a win.

Ha, you actually spend your weekends doing something social?! You weirdo.
