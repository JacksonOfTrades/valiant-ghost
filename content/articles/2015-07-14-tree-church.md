A man in New Zealand has built a church out of trees. Why, you ask, would a man build such a thing out of such a thing?

> "I walked out my back door one day and thought, 'That space needs a church' â€“ and so it began,"

Which seems fair enough.

Jokes aside, reading the article it is obvious that a lot of love and care has gone into the design of the church. The man, Barry Cox, clearly has a lot of faith and love for trees. Even the roof was designed for only a certain tree to be bent to provide roofing. While currently supported by iron frames, it is planned for in a few years for these to be removed so that the branches themselves can be used for the frame.

Now that's some fine engineering.
