Ashley Carmen, *The Verge*[^1]:

> The Australian Centre for Field Robotics called Otto Tag on a Wednesday afternoon. Tag was a farmer living in Australia. The Centre for Field Robotics was looking for a person with just those qualifications. The phone rang and Tag asked who was on the line.


> "Hi, yes, this is the Australian Centre for Field Robotics. And we’re calling to find out if you’d be interested in trying out one of our new robots for a week."


> "Uh, what," Tag replied.


> "It’s called SwagBot. Basically, [it’s a robot that acts like a sheep dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxAWlhRlQ9U). We’ve been working on it for months and we want to test it out on a real farm in the real world. You’re the closest farm to our lab, so we figured we’d try you first."

They gave all the swag they could to a single farming robot?[^2]
