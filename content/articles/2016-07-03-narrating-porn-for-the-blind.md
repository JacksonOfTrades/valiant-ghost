Apparently there's only 50 videos of narrated pornography[^1] currently in existence. In wanting to assist the visually impaired people of the community Jimmy Kimmel sought to improve that number by asking random people on the street to narrate a video for them. I was glad to see there was at least one guy taking it seriously-ish.


[^1]: I haven't done my own research on it, but I'll take Kimmel's word for it.
