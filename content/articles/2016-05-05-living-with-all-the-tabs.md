Fun fact: One of these tabs is actually 20 tabs.

Considering how my friends and the internet lose their freaking minds every time I show them how many tabs I have open[^1], I'm going to write about how I manage with all these tabs. And yes, this is another post about [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com), the objectively best browser. But it makes the process of living with a tab addiction so simple.

Instead of mindlessly clicking through them, by simply pressing `f2` and typing in the title of the page I want, and because a lot of the time it's news stories that I plan to read in my tabs and modern headlines are pretty good, it's usually pretty easy to find what I want, even within a stacked tab.

In Chrome, it might be harder. But my hardcore tab addiction, up there with my coffee addiction, is easier to manage with the warm glow of Vivaldi's quick commands feature.
