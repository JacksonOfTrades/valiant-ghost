Mobility Designed are working on something that desperately needs to be fixed, the centuries old design of medical crutch. Instead of all the weight being in your armpits, Mobility Designed Crutches have all the weight be in your elbows, making them more comfortable. I myself have never had to use crutches[^1] but I've seen people who have needed them and the struggle they have to move around in them, and I'm sure this new crutch will come as a much needed improvement.
