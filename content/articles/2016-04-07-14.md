Chaika Ep 9: I guess I should've known from the beginning of this episode that it was going to be one that explores the background of the characters. No action here, but a hell of a lot of story, about the backgrounds of Tooru and Akari and the Saboteurs. Plus some hint as to why Chaika is amnesiac.
