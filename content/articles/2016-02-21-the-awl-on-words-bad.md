Alex Balk, The Awl:

> Most longform is bad. The problem arises from the “long” part. If you need more than 600 words to say what you need to say you are trying too hard for accolades or you’re getting paid by the word. It is unfortunate that society conflates length with depth and quantity with complexity, but no one who cuts the checks will agree to pay more for less.

I like it. I'm an *okay* writer, but writing anything above 1000 words is just too hard to convince myself that it's woth publishing here. My recent [Twidere review](https://valiantghost.com/2016/02/twidere ) is only 1005 words long. Not because I'm lazy and I didn't want to write anymore, but because I capped. I got most of the important stuff out of the way,  if I wrote anything more it would just be writing for the sake of writing. I don't want to just throw move the cursor on this screen along just to fill some self allocated word count[^1] but I want what I write to make sense. Hell, I don't even have to write as much as I have here for a single link post, no limit, no cap, I just want to.

And I hope what I wrote made sense.

[^1]: I actually don't have any word count or restrictions here. In fact I don't actually have any regularity here on this site. If I sit down at think to myself *"This week, you need to write 1000 words for Valiant Ghost"* then I will inevidably just lose all interest. I ran a weblog before this one like that. It did not work out for me.
