![IRI~!](/images/fgoparty/iri.jpg)

Well, with the aquisition of Irisviel that's most of my involvement in this event gone. I can say I did not enjoy the event at all. In it's premise and writing it was alright, but the event as a whole was way too grindy for my liking. At least now I can restore my team to normal.
