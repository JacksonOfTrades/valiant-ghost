Watch some Star Wars Lego explode in glorious 3000fps and relive the old childhood memories of watching that Lego spaceship you spent hours building shattered in an instant when you dropped it onto the hardwood floor that one time. This is what true pain looks like, and had me squirming and cringing in the painful memories.
