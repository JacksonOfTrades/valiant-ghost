![Whats wrong with these?](/images/verge-frown.0.jpg)

From [this](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/16/11441876/android-n-new-emoji-closer-look) Verge article, the Android N emoji, the Apple Emoji and the current Android Emoji. The new emoji is too similar with Apple's design, while the current designs feel more original. The blobs look more fluid and alive than just the little faces they are changing to.
