Okay, look I swear I'm going to stop linking so many TEDtalks soon[^1] but my friend actually sent me this one rather than me finding it on my own: A video on a test to see what makes a person indeed a human. It's funny, witty and overall makes you think, on our emotions and feelings. Frank's presentation of this talk is wonderfully strange and monotone, but glorious all the same.
