title: Can we talk about baths?

To follow up what I just wrote about, can we talk about how weirdly good baths are? I've only just started having them again after six years of avoiding them like the plague[^1] and the first thing I notice is how weird they are, but also relaxing.

After six years, you get used to the feel of scalding hot water rushing down your back and over your shoulders, before being replaced with new water. The constant stinging pressure is a reminder that you are being cleaned, there is no time to relax and you should get out as soon as you are clean.

But there's none of that with a bath. Once you are in the scalding the scalding remains. It is hot and stagnant, with whatever bubbly stuff you used to get the required bubbles[^2] somehow mysteriously moving into a position which makes the scene as PG as possible in case anyone for some reason decides to walk in.

And it somehow is relaxing, the constant warm caressing you like a blanket, against the near freezing cold you feel when you remove yourself despite the fact its not to cold tonight. And when you get out, you feel even more sleepy and relaxed then when you got in there. You climb into bed, pull your laptop towards you and start writing an article for your blog when there's a million of more productive things you could be doing. 

WHY IS THAT? I've only been awake for nine hours at time of writing, but I feel like wrapping myself in a blanket and sleeping for a long time. This is not right. I am a writer. Writer's do not even consider sleep until they sit on the indefinite hour where you're not sure whether it's very late at night or very early in the morning, and shouldn't wake up until the time period known as the magic hour for photographers has long since past and all traces that there was something other than a giant ball of plasma in the sky have long since retreated. 

But instead here I sit, half my body covered by a heavy-ish and very comfortable blanket writing into my blog, looking up and giggling a little bit back when the word count was 420 when I last took a glance at it. I also had a coffee when I took the bath, so you would at least think the two would cancel out. But nope, I'm feeling very sleepy, even though I probably won't actually stop staring at this screen until about 3am. 

Writers life yo!


[^1]: Can't remember why, probably something to do with my OCD.

[^2]: What do you mean bubbles aren't required? Of course they're required! Who doesn't have baths without bubbles. It's like... a cardinal sin not to have them.
