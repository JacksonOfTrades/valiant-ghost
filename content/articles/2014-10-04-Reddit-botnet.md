Huh, what to you know? I never thought reddit would be the site to give me a virus[^1]. And I mean the site, not links from the site. The fact it posts to [/r/minecraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft) is pretty creative, I do admit.

Edit: I have just found out it was not the Minecraft sub, but a fake imitation sub[^2].

[^1]: And when I say 'me' I don't mean I can get infected. Windows Master Race! (God I hate people who say that.)

[^2]: Now with added Malware, for that ruined feel.
