I love tilt-shift photography, its just one of those really cool things that I've never actually managed to do more [than once](https://www.flickr.com/photos/manotheclassics/22849234572/in/dateposted-public/). I seriously need to get back into doing tilt-shift photography because it's a pretty cool thing.

If you too like tilt-shift photography, there's a [subreddit for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/tiltshift/) which I am now subscribed to.
