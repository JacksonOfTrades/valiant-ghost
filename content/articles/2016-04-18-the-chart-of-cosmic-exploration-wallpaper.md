[Kottke](http://kottke.org/16/03/the-chart-of-cosmic-exploration) a week ago alerted us to the [Chart of Cosmic Exploration](https://www.popchartlab.com/products/the-chart-of-cosmic-exploration), a chart which "traces the trajectories of every orbiter, lander, rover, flyby, and impactor to ever slip the surly bonds of Earth's orbit and successfully complete its mission -- a truly astronomical array of over 100 exploratory instruments in all". And during my many reddit travels I came across a [wallpaper version](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/4f7x9p/what_are_some_wallpapers_similar_to_this_one/). I'm such a big visual data nerd this is going straight in my wallpaper folder.
