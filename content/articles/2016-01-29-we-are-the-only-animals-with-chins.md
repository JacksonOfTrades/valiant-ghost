> The lower jaw of a chimpanzee or gorilla slopes backwards from the front teeth. So did the jaw of other hominids like *Homo erectus*. Even Neanderthal jaws ended in a flat vertical plane. Only in modern humans does the lower jaw end in a protruding strut of bone. A sticky-outy bit. A chin.

> “It's really strange that only humans have chins,” says [James Pampush](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/people/james-pampush) from Duke University. “When we're looking at things that are uniquely human, we can't look to big brains or bipedalism because our extinct relatives had those. But they didn't have chins. That makes this immediately relevant to everyone.” Indeed, except in rare cases involving birth defects, everyone has chins. Sure, some people have less pronounced ones than others, perhaps because their lower jaws are small or they have more flesh around the area. But if you peeled back that flesh and exposed their jawbones—and maybe don't do that—you'd still see a chin.

And now to lay awake at night and ponder why I have this protrusion on the bottom of my lovely face.
