title: Nakedness - Attachment to your phone

I'm currently writing this on the way to an outdoor leadership course[^1] and I feel a certain nakedness about me. Not because I'm physically naked, I'm wearing a jacket and jeans despite it being 21 degrees Celsius in summer[^2] but because I lack my mobile phone

We're not allowed to take any technology above a camera on this course, another reason I'm probably going to despise it, therefore I left my phone at home. And at the minute I got in the car I felt a oddly exposed without my phone on me. Not just because it lacks me the ability to make calls to anyone, but it’s a way for me to be connected to the world, to know nearly everything in seconds. Right now, I don't have it on me, so I can’t know everything, people cannot contact me instantly, I am alone, save for the other people in this car with me.

I've always prided myself on not being addicted to my phone. My computer, yes, but not my phone. But maybe I am. It could be because I have a new Android phone which I love and I've become attached to the phone. Either way, it’s interesting to see the effects on me, to see how actually dependent I am on my phone.

And I've got another week of this.

[^2]: You ever notice how if you wear a jacket and jeans in 21 degrees in summer, it’s too hot to wear but in winter its perfect? For more examples, see <a href="<https://brooksreview.net/2015/11/mysteries/>">The Brooks Review - Mysteries</a>.
