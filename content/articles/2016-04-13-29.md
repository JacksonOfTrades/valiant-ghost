The Great Gatsby: A different kind of movies for a different kind of novel. It's a typical Baz Luhrmann film, the scenes cut fast and never focus on one single person long enough for it to be considered a 'normal' shot.. The music is a mix of modern and classical, it'll be hard to find another movie that mixes Jay-Z and Jazz into one scene. Each actor plays their role well, Myrtle Wilson is about as unattractive as the novel suggests she is, Daisy is gorgeously feminine, Tom is a big hulking brute, and Jordan has the tomboyishness. And for anyone who particularly enjoyed the novel, like I did, the movie uses a lot of quotes ripped straight from the book, although slightly dumbed down for the screen[^1]. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, and I recommend you see it. Still surprised Leo didn't get an Oscar for this.

[^1]: Let's be honest, some phrases in the novel are a bit *too* wordy
