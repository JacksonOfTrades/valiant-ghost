No, unfortunately, Beyonce is not making her own knock-off of [Fawlty Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawlty_Towers). Instead, there is a tower inspired by her in Melbourne, Australia. Yes, you read that correctly. 

As Valerie Chang reports:

> After last week’s <a href="http://designtaxi.com/news/377389/Stunning-Glass-House-Sits-Hidden-In-The-Edge-Of-A-Cliff-Overlooks-Aegean-Sea/" target="_blank">hidden cliff-side abode</a>, here’s its attention-grabbing polar opposite—a <a href="http://elenbergfraser.com/#!/project/13012_premier-tower" target="_blank">swanky skyscraper</a> inspired by artiste Beyoncé’s music video, <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY9vZv7HCvo" target="_blank">Ghost</a></i>.

>The brainchild of architecture and interior design firm <a href="http://elenbergfraser.com/" target="_blank">Elenberg Fraser</a>, the 226-meter-tall building has a curvilinear form and is located directly in front of Southern Cross station in Melbourne. 

Weird as it is, I like it. But I still want Beyonce's Fawlty Towers knock-off.
