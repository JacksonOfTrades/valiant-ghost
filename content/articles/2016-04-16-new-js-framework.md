Thanks to [Khoi Vinh](https://www.subtraction.com/2016/04/14/portrait-of-a-front-end-programmer/) I found this glorious combination of classical art pieces with the woes of the modern programmer. The above is entitled *'Frontend developers approach newly released JS framework'*. My second favorite would have to be *['Sysadmin grants sudo privileges to developer on production web server'](http://classicprogrammerpaintings.tumblr.com/post/142602959384/sysadmin-grants-sudo-privileges-to-developer-on)*. Awesome.
