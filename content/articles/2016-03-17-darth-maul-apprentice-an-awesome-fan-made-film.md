A culmination of two years of effort from a devoted fan team bought us this: Darth Maul Apprentice, a non-profit fan made film that give us a bit of fan made insight into the Darth from the prequels. Aside from just being a cool little bit of fan film, it has an awesome style in its cinematography and stunts.

The [making of video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDCNTLzTgSo) if also awesome and funny and gave me something I never thought I'd see: Darth Maul as Marry Poppins and Darth Maul eating a pizza. 

I personally have great respect for this team, it took them two years to make this but they managed to churn out something very high quality and incredibly awesome. My metaphorical hat goes off to them[^1].
