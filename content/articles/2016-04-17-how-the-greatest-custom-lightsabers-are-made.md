Over at *The Verge* Bryan Bishop interviews the guys who make the most awesome custom lightsabers, all fanmade

> I’m in a suburb 30 miles outside of Sacramento, California, and Yoda’s teaching me how to fight with a lightsaber.


> In this particular case, Yoda is the online nickname for Michael Murphy, a 43-year-old artist that makes his living building high-end custom lightsabers — including the ones we’re using — but that doesn’t make the lesson any less intense. I step forward, my blue blade cutting through the air with an unmistakeable *thrumm*. My blow is easily parried, our sabers clashing hot white. He pivots, blade twirling behind his back as he executes a 360-degree spin that I’m pretty sure I’ve seen Ewan McGregor pull off.


> He swings straight for my head, and as I bring my saber up to block I can’t help but think two things: *This is probably what Daisy Ridley felt like,* and *I have to get me one of these.*

Seriously: WATCH THE VIDEO AND READ THE WHOLE THING. The amount of detail in each 'saber is incredibly impressive.
