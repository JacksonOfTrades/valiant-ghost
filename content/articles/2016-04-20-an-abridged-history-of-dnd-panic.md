Pri discusses the panic that surrounded the release of Dungeons and Dragons in the 80's and 90's, who the media labelled it satanic and all that. Just the existance of such claims furthers my belief that the media just look for something to blame the behaviour of *those gosh dark youngin's today* on instead of themselves.
