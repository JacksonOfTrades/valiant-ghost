Asher Elbein, *The Atlantic*:

> With the rise of mass-media intellectual properties and ascendant geek culture, the tendency to treat the original comics, novels, and video games like holy writ has spread out of fan communities and into the larger cultural conversation. Creators and critics alike now are expected to be well-versed in source materials. J.J Abrams’s 2009 *Star Trek* reboot went to great lengths to establish itself as canonical; the very existence of *The Force Awakens* [spurred a cottage industry](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-15/why-disney-blew-up-more-than-30-years-of-star-wars-canon) of writers to analyze the film’s departures from the Star Wars “expanded universe” it had replaced. A good portion of the Internet firestorm around *Batman v Superman*has been couched in terms of its fealty or deviation from comics. Canon, in other words, is king, and if you want to talk about anything geek-related, you’d better have your credentials at the ready.


> There’s only one problem with true canon: It doesn’t exist. And in an effort to hold people to it, enthusiasts strangle criticism, hamstring creators, and make fan communities far more toxic for everybody.

The problem with following the 'True' canon is a problem I often run into in a lot of anime series which are adapted from manga. When most anime series are made at the same time as the manga they often churn out episodes faster than the manga authors can keep up, and eventually overtake them. 

And then of course, this leads to the anime having to veer off in its own direction away from the source material[^1]. The original Hellsing anime did this, Soul Eater did this, and so did Akame Ga Kill. This nearly leads to a disappointing and rushed ending to the anime. 

Which means that in order to be a 'true fan' you have to read the manga/light novel of a series you already partially know, simply because it's different. This annoys me intensely, and I wish there was a better way around this. But no, the manga is popular so the anime companies want to make it into an anime which almost always has a meh ending.
