> There’s a new trend in the wrist-wear game and it’s taking over men’s style by storm- skeleton watches.  Artfully crafted & fascinating to watch (pun!), nowadays you can catch many a stylish man brazenly flashing his timepiece’s innards in place of what was once fervently concealed.  Skeleton watches are cool, nifty, and gosh darn it they’re damn sexy.  The smoothness and subtly of curvilinear, stationary features juxtaposed with rigid, ever-ticking mechanics make for a beautiful dichotomy one can wear right on their wrist and take wherever they go.

Personally, I'm a huge watch person. I've always wanted a skeleton watch, but it's one of those things I've never got around to buying.  I've owned every other kind of watch; analogue, digital, hybrid (analogue and digital), cheap, expensive, but never a skeleton. Mostly because my specifications for the skeleton watch I want are as such:

1. Has to be silver. Gold looks too flashy.

2. Has to have a metal wrist band, leather and rubber break too quickly and canvas frays too quickly in my experience.

3. Has to be self winding.

The problem is, most of these watches are expensive. 

The second problem is that my current watch, a Rotary Aquaspeed, was given to me as a birthday gift from my grandpa and I'm not going to just throw that away for a shiny skeleton watch[^1]. This watch won't break for a while yet. Maybe when it finally retires from active service I'll get a skeleton.

[^1]:  I tend to wear my watches into the ground. My last watch was a hand-me-down family thing, a Carve watch, given to me from my grandpa (again) after a decade of service with him. That watch served two years with me before it finally died permanently.
