After a lot[^1] of research, I can safely say I agree with the [Oatmeal that the Mantis Shrimp is literally the best animal of all time](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp), and it confirms my theory that all aquatic life is designed for only one thing; Confirm, Consume, Destroy. [Here's another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5FEj9U-CJM) showing how mantis shrimp are the rainbow nukes of the sea.

As the last surviving member of House Wyndow[^2] I now know that the Mantis Shrimp will be on my coat of arms when I eventually redesign[^3] it.



[^1]: About ten minutes in procrastination 

[^2]: So, I've just started watching Game of Thrones, and - Yes, ***Just*** - and I now must have a flag for House Wyndow.

[^3]: *"Wait... REdesign?"* Yep, my family has a coat of arms. Well, it's not the Wyndow one, but it's from my fathers side (I have my mothers last name), and I have basically made it my own. But it's bland and needs a Material redesign (I'm joking, I'll make it semi-official...ish.)
