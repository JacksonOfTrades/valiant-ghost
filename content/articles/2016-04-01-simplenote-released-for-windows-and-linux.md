Popular Mac app Simplenote has now been released for Windows and Linux. I'm currently trying it out by writing this post in it[^1] and as the name implies its got a minimal look, the main view to write notes, an Evernote-like side panel to display your notes a and a small topbar for settings and searching. There's also the stock standard day mode and night mode.

There's markdown support, as you can see from the above screenshot, although you have to toggle it on for each note. Currently no support for YAML front matter as far as I can tell :(. Notes also have a Git-like feature where they can be restored to certain points, handy if you ever accidently delete all the text like I do and close the app.

And finally, there's a handy feature to export your notes, either to collaborators or you can publish the note and link to it via a URL.  A cool little feature I found is that if you enable Markdown and use the footnotes syntax, the published note will have working markdown footnotes, a feature I often find underloved in a lot of markdown writing applications.

I've tried out a few note taking apps in my technology lifetime, although now I've settled on OneNote for the majority of my class notes/long(er) form stuff for VG and Instapaper for archiving things[^2]. I think Simplenote could fit in a small niche I need for my writing workflow, especially for [publishing on mobile](/2016/02/heroku-middleman/).  And besides, there's not much good native note taking app for Windows like this, so its worth a shot.

You can [download simplenote from their websitre](http://simplenote.com/).

P.S. You can see the original note written in Simplenote [here](http://simp.ly/p/624hY7)

[^1]: Which I will then export to Typora so I can actually save/spellcheck it. Theres no spellcheck in Simplenote BTW idsbfopiad.
[^2]: It was Google Keep for a while, but Instapaper is obviously better.
