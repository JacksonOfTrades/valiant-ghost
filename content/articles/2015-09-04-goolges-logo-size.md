You may have heard that Google's new logo can be compressed to only 305 *bytes* of data. How in gods name is that possible? A blogger by the name of Nitin Kumar took it upon himself to find out.

> The old logo of Google is 14,000 bytes.

> The old logo uses a complicated serif font which can only be created using bezier curves. All together, it has 100 anchor points, resulting in a 6 KB (6,380  bytes) file. When compressed, the size comes down to 2 KB (2,145 bytes).

> A simplified version of the new logo, on the other hand, can be constructed almost entirely from circles and rectangles (with the exception of the lower-case g):

While this article does not compress the new logo to the 305 bytes we were promised, it does show how the logo could be compressed in order to save bandwidth. How much bandwidth could be saved you ask? [This reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3jl0c2/how_googles_new_logo_is_just_305_bytes/cuq67oz) has the answers for you.

On a related note, I actually quite like the new logo, unlike [some](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-you-hate-googles-new-logo) [people](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/01/google-logo). I did like the serifs, but the new logo is a nice change. They've had the old logo for as long as I can remember, back when Google was just... Google, the search engine. Its not longer just a search engine any more. Its an email service, map service, mobile OS developer and browser maker. The new logo is a nice fresh kick in a new direction, for a new Google. 

People hate change, they always do. They'll get used to it.
