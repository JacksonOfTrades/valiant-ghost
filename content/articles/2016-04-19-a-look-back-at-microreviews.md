Well, with last night's conclusion of Chaika: The Coffin Princess I finish my microreview experiment I was trying here.  I found it quite fun, doing these little reviews of an episode and experimenting with this new, shorter style of blogging. 

But will I be doing to again? For anime episodes probably not. While I did enjoy it by the end of the series I just became burned out with writing a little thought on each episode. My original microblog posts were fun to write, but the later ones just became slightly more lacking in energy as they just became a thing to do, rather than something I enjoyed. 

I will continue do it for [books](https://valiantghost.com/2016/04/35/) because they're longer and I don't have to do it in periodic increments. I also might do some twitter style blogging here, along with releasing the code for how I wrote hte microblogging into Middleman.

I am now at a crossroads of deciding what to put where. For example, I am massive anime fan and want to put my no-context images on here, but I would rather keep my more professional writings and cooler findings here, instead of polluting it with tumblr like memes, while having my more goofy anime side be displayed more promanantly on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ManOTheClassics){:title="Me on twitter in case you didn't know"}. 

Here however I'll use the microblog functionality to post things along the lines of running thoughts and little twitter like updates. With the lack of word limit I can have it be as long as I like, which is incredibly attractive.
