On a World War II battlefield, a bullet was found inverted into the case. Inside was a hidden message.

> [...] the military used the shells to hide encoded messages (for radio equipment ciphers, for example) or recognition codes for the units themselves or positions of stations in the form of codes.
>The bullet was removed from the case and the powder charge discarded. Then they hid the note into the empty shell. Since ammunition could be found everywhere in the battlefield, these were very easy to hide, as they mixed with the rest of the ammunition. In case of capture it was easy to discard them and throw them away immediately.

When decrypted, the message reads:

>"THEY - THROW - GRENADES - WE - PULL - PINS - AND - THROW - BACK"

Now, I could make the Blond joke about a hand grenade[^1] but I'm far to civil for that.
