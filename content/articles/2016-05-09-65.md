And speaking of Chaika *Trabant* I'm also wondering where the last names of the Chaika's came from? Their life before the were reprogrammed? If so, is it possible for a third season/spin off, where Toru and Akari try to find their original families? I'm sure the writer of the light novel could make that interesting.
