From The Awl, a quote/rant that really resonates with me:

> You guys, what do you call it when you open up a new tab and then forget why you opened it in the first place? I usually go with “tabstraction,” containing as it does “abstraction,” “distraction” and “tab” but shielding my sensitive feelings from the considerably more appropriate “you fucking moron, I *told* you the Internet would ruin whatever shitty level of focus you had left, God what a disappointment you are to me and everyone who ever counted on you,” which I think we can all agree is a bit wordy. Anyway, I am happy for alternate suggestions, but otherwise “tabstraction” it is. Speaking of tabstractions, I completely forgot what I was going to do just a few moments ago, so until I figure it out why not enjoy this terrific track? And keep opening those tabs!
