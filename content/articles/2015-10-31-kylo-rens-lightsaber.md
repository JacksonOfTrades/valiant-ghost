title: What the hell is up with Kylo Ren's lightsaber?

While looking at the SVG lightsabers I came across Kylo Ren's[^1] own weapon of choice:

<img src="http://dcmjs.com/lightsabers/images/kylo.svg">

Looking at it, [and it is a faithful representation of the actual lightsaber](http://au.ign.com/articles/2015/04/17/get-a-close-up-look-at-kylo-rens-crossguard-lightsaber-from-star-wars-the-force-awakens), it just looks kind of shabby compared to the rest of the elegantly crafted lightsabers there, wires exposed, the bolts holding it together and those crossguards[^2]. 

It reminded me of a conversation I had with my friend about it the other day about Kylo's lightsaber and it's hilt guard. All lightsabers are home made, but Kylo's is a special kind of home made, lacking the elegance that the original lightsabers provide for a more unique, human approach[^3].

So why the crossguards? Well the theory my friend put out was that the lightsaber was more unstable than the lightsabers used by most Jedi and Sith, and therefore the crossguard is an exhaust port for the energy. Which makes sense if you look at the images. The main blade looks fiery and unstable looking. Most likely if all that energy were not exhausted in some way it could prove dangerous for the wielder and other people in the immediate vicinity.

Time will tell why on earth[^4] he has the crossguards.

[^2]: I'll tell you now, I'm one of those people who think the crossguard looks fucking stupid.
[^3]: Like that crappy wax candle you made once at a workshop and even though it was terrible you were still proud of it.
