*Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works Spoilers*

I have a bone to pick with the Fate Series. In Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works we are told that servants can be summoned whether they are from the past, present or *future*. But the only servant to come from the future is EMIYA (Archer)[^2], who came back with the rather badass goal of going back in time to kill his younger self[^3]. 

Of course, there's a reason for the lack of heroes summoned from the future. The Fate series is centered around summoning heroes of legend and myth into the modern world to have an epic battle over the Holy Grail. Half the fun of the original Fate/Stay Night was guessing who the hell the identities of the heroes summoned[^4],  by adding heroes from the future you remove the fun of guessing and half of what makes the series interesting.

With servants from the future, what would make Fate unique compared to other series of its kind? Not much. But it's just odd to include the functionality of summoning heroes from the future and only using it once. 


[^2]: Because there's an Assassin EMIYA who's *way* cooler. Guess who it is.
[^3]: Surely something similar to the [Grandfather paradox](https://valiantghost.com/2016/05/grandfather-paradox/) would come into play here, right? If he went back in time to kill his younger self, the act would either cancel out or it would create an alternate timeline where EMIYA is still stuck as a [Counter Guardian](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Heroic_Spirit#Counter_Guardian). 
[^4]: Fate/Zero really didn't bother with this, much to my sadness. The only one to really do it was Berserker, who I guessed correctly after his first appearance.
