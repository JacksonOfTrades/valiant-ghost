Slight spoilers for Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion[^1]

Reddit user twilot_spankle has put forth this theory on the Mehrunes Dagons goal during the Oblivion Crisis, the events that take place during the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

> When comparing Molag Bal and Mehrunes Dagon, you start to realize something. Everyone thinks that both wanted to merge their planes with Nirn for the sole reason of enslaving man and mer. Now this may have been the case with Molag Bal, as his sphere is that of enslavement and domination, it is NOT the reason for Mehrunes Dagon's invasion.

>... Dagon's plan wasn't to fuse Nirn with The Deadlands, he knows how powerful mortals can be, the Tribunal and Tiber Septim are proof of that. His true goal was not to merge, but to bring about CHANGE and REVOLUTION!

I like this theory. It delves a bit deeper into the lore than most would try to[^2] but it puts forth an interesting idea about a villains goal. Makes Dagon seem deeper than what we're presented in the game.


[^1]: Even though its nine years old, which by my book is old enough to not care about spoilers

[^2]: And trust me, if you do delve into the lore then it gets really deep. For example: The entire Elder Scrolls universe takes place in the dream of a schizophrenic man. The more you know.
