[Listening to the original Hellsing soundtrack](https://valiantghost.com/2016/07/91/) I came across the knowledge that, apparently, the opening for Hellsing in German is much, much different. And after listening to the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBPegoYoD9Q) I listened to the [German opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDz1lEC-jDc). Mein Gott is it different!
