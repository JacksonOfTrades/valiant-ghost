![The Gundo/Gandr. One of my favorite weapons.](/images/column/gundo/gundo1.jpg)

*Welcome to* The Right Tool For The Job *a column series where I attempt to give a highly objective analysis and review of a weapon from an anime series. Alucard may be one of the coolest vampires clad all in red, but his two massive handguns are often associated with him as much as his floppy hat and glasses. Akame Ga Kill has a lovely cast of characters, but their Imperial Arm's are pretty interesting even without the people. Note that each column in this series will likely lead to spoilers about the series. You have been warned.*

Throughout the medium of fantasy fiction, an [apparatus for a wizard to channel their magic through](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrutch?from=Main.MagicFocusObject) is an incredibly common item for any budding wizard. Whether in the form of a staff or a wand, you rarely see a magic user throwing around magic with their bare hands. One of the best wizard staves *and* symbolic image Ive ever seen is the Gundo/Gandr, the weapon used by wizards in *Chaika: The Coffin Princess*. Not only does does cover you in the magic using section but also the coolness section. Because we all know a a wizard is ranked by how cool they look.

### The History

The Gundo was created by the enigmatic Emperor Gaz, one of the many magic related experiments the old emperor created, in the shape of a modern rifle or cannon. They 'fire' magic bullets, crystalised memories and emotions, later explained as the source of magic in the world. By connecting via a wire to the back of their neck, a wizard can 'fire spells'. 

As the gundo's are literally using the emotions and memories to fuel their magic, the 'bullet' is optional but acts as a covenant way to hold the magic, a wizard can instead opt to use their own memories to power their magic, which later becomes vital to how Gaz is killed.

While in the Light Novel[^1]  Gundo's are big, weighty things more like an artillery cannon than a magic staff in the anime they're presented as mainly portable guns. Chaika Trabant's own Gundo takes the form of a  .50 Cal sniper rifle kept dismantled inside a coffin, they come in a variety of shapes. Claudia Dodge, one of the Eight Heroes who slew Gaz[^2], has a Gundo similar in appearance to a lever action rifle, of Mattheus's gundo is a large break action sniper rifle. The only time this trend is broken is with Niva Lada, gundo of Gaz himself. She's an organic gundo who can transform into a giant cannon similar to the description of gundo's in the original Light Novel, forming around Gaz's arm and Chaika's gundo, making her already large rifle even bigger.

### Would I use it?

I personally love the gundo. Its form, a highly portable and badass looking rifle, is the perfect substitute for a modern wizard staff. Give me the option of Gandalf's staff versus a gundo and I'll pick the gundo any day.  Assuming you never run out of magic fuel and have the time to utter each magic word, the gundo's come with little in the way of a disadvantge[^3].

### THE GUNDO

<div style="float: right; width: calc(50%)">

Pros:

<li> Easily portable</li>
<li> Looks more badass than a staff or wand</li>
<li> Has a theoretically infinite source of magic</li>

</div>

<div style="float: left; width: calc(50%)">

Cons:

<li>Could potentially lead to you forgetting some awesome memories</li>
<li>Takes a long time to actually fire a spell, as opposed to just shooting someone with an actual .50 Caliber sniper rifle. Unless you somehow shorten the procedure like Claudia Dodge</li>

[^2]: And the current owner of his heart, literally.

[^3]: Hell, you could even argue that using the gundo's memory absorbing capabilities could be useful (We've all got a few memories we want to be gone, right?) than it is troublesome. Especially if your backs against the wall. Gotta fire a spell but got no magic fuel. It's fine, just hope that the memories of failing that year 10 math's quiz, which has shamed you to this day, is what kills the dragon.
