*I was clearing out my Dropbox folder when I came across a post I'd originally written for a high school assessment, titled* "Where I think the Web is going"*. I never finished it, and instead wrote [Ads the good the bad and the ugly and why if we go we're screwed](https://valiantghost.com/2015/11/advertising/). The original post was broken up into sections, most of which were terrible but I think I did alright with what I thought was the future of Web design.*

As much as I loathe to admit this, I think the Shepard of web design is Apple. With the early versions of iOS trying to project a metallic 3D design, websites trends followed. When iOS 7 went flat, so did the trend in web design. It's an understandable trend, Apple is an industry leader so any designer in their right mind would try and design a website like Apple.

So, where can we go from here? Websites were originally flat, then we went to websites being popped up and now we're back to websites being flat. It's an obvious cycle, so we need to 'pop' again. Rather than pop up, I think this time we'll pop down. Google's Material Design is perfect for this. The original idea behind the early 2000's 'pop' effect was to create depth and a futuristic feel to websites. Material Design pops down, allowing for depth while still retaining the modern, flat look. Modern websites can attain this effect without needing to add Material Design by simply using a border-shadow effect to their websites CSS.

Of course, we need to watch Apple closely. As stated, they are the Shepherd of web design. Whatever effect they create next, which I would love to see, will be what the new web design trend is.
