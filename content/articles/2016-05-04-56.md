I've been supporting Kanye West for U.S. President in 2020 since I heard about it, because if we let someone like Trump run for President, why not a rapper? But then I came to the conclusion that this would probably lead to Kim Kardashian as the First Lady, which leads me to say [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ). After we've had Michelle Obama, that would be a nightmare.
