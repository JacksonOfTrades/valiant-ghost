Remember when Marty O'Donnell was fired from Bungie? I was pretty shocked, especially considering the fact it was 'without cause'.

Well, we now know why:

> In April of 2014 Martin “Marty” O’Donnell, then Bungie’s audio director, was fired from the company “without cause.” A court ruling issued last week in a case between the composer and his former employer sheds light on the events leading up to his termination and the hand Activision played in souring their relationship.

So yes, it was Activation's fault. Surprise surprise.
