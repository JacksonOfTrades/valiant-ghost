Despite what people I know will tell you, I hate sleep with a passion. It feels like such a waste of time. One minute its 12am and the next minute your alarms buzzing, telling you its 7am and time to get up. There have been a few times I've had dreams I enjoy, but most of these times they are always mundane daily routines I do. 

I only get around seven hours sleep, but thats mostly because I work better tired, rather than wide awake. I've solved many academic and programming problems as I teeter in and out of conciousness.

According to the linked article, thats a good thing:

> A regular sleep cycle consists of four stages. In the first, we’re technically not asleep, but are on our way. We spend about 5 minutes in Stage 1 sleep, though it can last longer. Brain activity begins to slow down; body temperature starts to drop; muscles relax; eyes move slowly from side-to-side
... While you’re in this state, you may see visions and hallucinations (often of shapes, patterns, and symbolic imagery), hear noises (including your own name or imagined speech), and feel almost physical sensations that relate to what you spent the day doing (like swimming in waves or riding in a boat). You may feel like you’re bobbing, floating, or falling (which is why you sometimes wake up from Stage 1 sleep with a jerk). The experience can essentially be described as “dreaming while awake.”

So apparently, you should sleep, wake up instantly and write anything down you do? Sounds good to me. The less sleep, the better.
