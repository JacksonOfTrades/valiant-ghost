title: Scientists invent super strong 3D printed ceramics

Scientists at  HRL Laboratories have invented a new type of ceramic, which they can 3D print and stronger than ordinary ceramics

> "The problem is that ceramics are just notoriously difficult to process," says Zak Eckel, an engineer at HRL Laboratories in Malibu, California.

> Heat-resistant ceramics require crazy-high temperatures to melt, so it's been a struggle to develop methods to 3D-print them. Today, there are just a few 3D printing techniques on the market that use any ceramics (developed by companies like 3DCERAM and Lithoz), but the approaches are severely limited in the types of ceramics they can print, as well as the end quality of their materials. Eckel and his team have just developed an altogether new way to 3D print practically flawless ceramicsâ€”including fantastically heat-resistant varieties that've so far been beyond our reach. Their research is announced today in the journal Science.

> To understand why Eckel's new printing process creates such interesting ceramics, it helps to understand why today's 3D printing approaches are so limited. To put it simply, they use clever techniques that basically print consecutive layers of ceramic particles that are suspended with a glue-like binding resin. (Imagine sand particles suspended in glue and you've got the idea). Once you're done printing a part this way, you can heat it up in a furnace to fuze the individual ceramic particles together into one big ceramic piece, and dissolve away the binding glue. 

Freaking awesome.
