In all fairness, Apple really underused them.

>In addition to the Apple Watch screens, Apple uses GT's sapphire for its camera covers and Touch ID sensors.

Considering the Apple Watch is only one inch in size, along with the tiny camera lens and touch ID sensor, they produced really small pieces of glass.

I do understand [*why*](http://time.com/3377972/why-apple-didnt-use-sapphire-iphone-screens/) it wasn't used for the screen, but just using it for camera lens's and fingerprint scanners seemed really silly.
