Empire: 

> Joining Tatooine, Endor, Naboo and the already-revealed desert planet of Jakku are Takodana, D'Qar and Hosnian Prime. Little is known of these mysterious orbs. Takodana will, if LEGO’s tie-in kits are to be believed, be the site of a major battle in the movie, while rumours have D’Qar as a resistance base. Hosnian Prime? Well, that’s a mystery to all.

Still hoping for more Knights of the Old Republic planets in there.
