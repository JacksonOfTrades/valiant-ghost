![My Homescreen](/images/homescreen.jpg){: .vertical}

This is a thing people do right? We share the Home screens of our mobile devices? I've redesigned my personal Home screen for as much minimalism as possible. As Android does not require you to have literally every app displayed on the home screen, I can cut away at the apps I never use for the ones I do. 

The layout itself is designed for how I hold my phone[^1]. While these are all the apps I use frequently, the ones on the right are the apps I use more frequently[^2]. In my dock[^3] I follow the rules of my [phone using lifestyle](valiantghost.com/2016/04/living-in-perpetual-airplane-mode/), with my favorite apps that use internet, [reddit is fun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit), [Inbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.inbox), [Discord](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord) and [Twidere](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mariotaku.twidere)[^4] are on the left of the screen, out of [comfortable thumb reach](http://alistapart.com/article/how-we-hold-our-gadgets){:title="An interesting article by A List Apart on holding devices and where to put optimal tap targets"}, while [Jotterpad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x) and [Simplenote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.automattic.simplenote) are on the right, where I can tap them easily[^5].

In the row above the dock and The Sabers are the apps I use slightly less frequently than the docked apps, but not infrequently enough to be placed in *The Draw*, that horrible place no apps hope to go. - The land of all apps hardly gleaned at except in the direst of times. The only real offline app there is Instapaper, which I use way more than I probably should. 

I really quite like this layout, as opposed to the [KLWP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.wallpaper) theme [I used for [six months](http://trinitynox.deviantart.com/art/Liverpool-England-590654201)][^6]. The minimal, clean approach is really attractive, and the wallpaper is viewable at nearly all times[^7]. 

[^1]: Cradled in my right hand with my pinky acting as the only thing stopping it from falling, and using my thumb for navigation.
[^2]: Except for Snapseed, which I use more then the other left sided apps. However, as I'm more likely to open Snapseed from within the album app when scrolling through the photos I took rather than going through the app itself.
[^3]: It's [Nova Launcher by the way](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher). I've heard good things about [Lightning](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pierrox.lightning_launcher_extreme) but haven't got around to using it yet.
[^4]: Which I wrote a review for, you can [read it here](https://valiantghost.com/2016/02/twidere/).
[^5]: Jotterpad is usually for quick microblog/link posts or for editing while Simplenote is where my longer stuff is usually written.
[^6]: Sorry [@HowEChia](https://twitter.com/howechia), its a good theme.
[^7]: Oh god, including this that's seven footnotes. SEVEN! Why do I need so many damn footnotes in the first place? Why can't I be one of those writers whose brain does not go off at tangents and they can fit what they need to say in the main body of the text? I blame Terry Pratchett (RIP), his own style is heavily dependent on footnotes and he's one of my favorite writers. Or [Gruber over at DF](http://daringfireball.net) who I took way too much inspiration from when I started taking web writing seriously.
