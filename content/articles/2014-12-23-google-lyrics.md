This is a good idea, if it works. Which it didn't for me. Tried searching Stairway to Heaven[^1] gives me nothing and neither does Safety Dance.

This a new service, so it may take some time to get right. I do think the 'full lyrics on Google play' is a cheeky idea by them, but an effective way to advertise the service.

There is some worrying this will faze out other lyric sites, but I think certain ones (Like Genius) will keep going. Mostly because Genius actually tells you what the lyrics *mean*, rather than just the words.

[^1]: Which the post shows!
