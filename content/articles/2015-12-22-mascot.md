I don't exactly remember the exact moment I decided the icon/glyph for this site would be a spade, probably around the time of my obsession with [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/). He's got a star, I've got a spade. I also remember that around that same time I read [Daring Fireballs Blank Slate](http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/blank_slate) that what I needed, more than anything was a unique design[^1]. 

> Default templates are terrific for people who can’t or don’t want to design their own — but they’re terrible starting points for anyone attempting to establish their own unique brand. If you start with nothing, you’re forced to think about everything.

Other than my shade of blue[^2] I somehow got the idea that I needed my own distinct little mascot for this site. And so got around to doing it.

### The Original

I remember when VG was still just an idea I was toying around with in my mind that I came up with a mascot for this site. I'd already got the name of the website-to-be so the mascot came easily. I had a name for it (which I can't remember, it was Sparks or something like that) and for different pages it would have different looks and expressions. 

When it actually came time to put this site up, I forgot all about it. So all that came to mind was a ghost with a sword. However I wanted it to look fairly playful, so I made it more Pacman style. Thankfully my friend managed to draw it in a way that looked good in digital format.

It suited the site, and for a long time it worked. It's still the sites avatar on the [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/valiantghostcom/) mostly because I seemingly can’t get the current mascot to work. Anyway...

### The Current

The original Valiant Ghost was fine and all, very literal, very nice, but I felt I needed a simpler one, an easier branding for this site and something fitting the spades logo. 

It may come as no surprise to some that the mascot is inspired by Lord Death's mask from *Soul Eater*.

At the time I had just finished the anime and was trying to learn how to draw him. I cannot draw. I can design fine but when it comes to physically putting the design on paper it comes out worse than a childs drawing. But Lord Death was simple enough that even *I* should be able to draw him, right? Turns out I could with a bit of work.

But one day I drew one the center tooth to wide...

Which due to the general shape of the mask kind of made it look like a spade...

And therefore, the new mascot of Valiant Ghost was formed. I originally also planned to give it its own playful little reaper cloak/hood to wear, but never got around to actually designing it. I simply grabbed a random image of a spade online and edited the three holes in. 

I kind of like the current mascot a *little bit* better than the old one due to its simplicity, and I can edit it[^3] easier than I can the old mascot. 

Now I just need to give it a name.



[^1]: A stupid idea I realise today, you're probably coming to this site and reading this because you like what I write/link, not just the design.
[^2]: When I was still just playing around with this site, I had a prebuilt -GASP- theme, with a light mode and a dark mode. The dark mode was a shade of blue I liked, #33495f. Ever since that day I've liked that shade of blue and I've kept using it here.
[^3]: It's nearly Christmas, I'm going to change its color scheme to reflect the holidays soon. It'll probably be Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer ghost or something.
