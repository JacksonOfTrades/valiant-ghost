I dont know about you, but theres something oddly cathartic about seeing the paint all nicely lined up, hearing the calming music of the Slow Mo guys kick in and then see a big explosion of color come at your screen. Its just... brilliant. The entire video is just a series of explosion of color which is aesthetically pleasing.
