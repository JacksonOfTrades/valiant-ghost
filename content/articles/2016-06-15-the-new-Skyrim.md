Instead of doing what we actually want and announcing a new Elder Scrolls game[^1] Bethesda instead left us with [Skyrim: Remastered](http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/12/11917164/skyrim-remaster-announced-release-date-trailer-bethesda-e3-2016), their official paid graphical mod for Skyrim, and a release on consoles with modding support on console thanks to the Fallout 4 Engine. I don't really see the point of it, sure the added graphics are nice but a whole new game? Just for a new graphical patch and another console? I'd rather they just work on a new Elder Scrolls.

Sure, the fact you get it for free if you have all the DLC on the old version. But still if there's no new content I still fail to see the point. I'm sure many, many console gamers would prefer it if a new Elder Scrolls was announced.
