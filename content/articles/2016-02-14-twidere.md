![Welcome to Twidere. Here is your timeline](/images/twidere/timeline.png)

I use [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com) almost exclusively on my computer for all my desktop Twitter needs, whether that be simply viewing my twitter stream or for writing my own Tweetstorm. When I got an Android phone I found I needed an equivalent that provided what I needed; a fast, flexible experience that was better than the default Twitter client.

I found it.

And guess what its called? The title of this posts it totally not a hint. At all!

### Design

![Design](/images/twidere/stitch.jpg){: .vertical}

When you first launch Twidere (yes, that's the app I'm reviewing here) you can pick a number of customisable elements which can be changed later down the line. Twidere uses Material Design, like damn nearly every other android app, so most of the UI revolves around the design specification. Individual tweets are displayed as [cards](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/cards.html), which you can customise heavily, everything from the font size and weight, the size of the cards, whether the profile image is displayed and you can even decide how links are highlighted.

There's also the stock standard night mode, and the background can be changed to pure white/black, which is helpful for saving battery on AMOLED displays. The background can also be changed to be completely transparent, which I thought was a nice touch although it does make the tweets a bit hard to read, especially combined with my custom [KWLP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.wallpaper) theme and Johnny Cash staring into my soul[^1].

When viewing your main twitter stream, sliding your thumb from the left causes a sidebar to slide out, giving you access to your profile page, a search menu, a link to your liked tweets, your lists, you accounts, drafted tweets, the ability to filter out tweets and the settings for the app.

Keeping with it's TweetDeck similarities, there is a customisable tab bar along the top of the app, which I have tried to keep as similar to my TweetDeck setup as possible: Home, then my tweets, mentions, messages, like/favorites and my tweets that have been retweets (Very few, but it's nice to have the feature). You can also change the color of the bar along the top, which is a nice touch[^2].

Oh, and you can change the hearts back to stars. I figure a few people will like that.

### Profile Page

![Profile](/images/twidere/profile.png){: .vertical}

A user's profile section is largely informative at a single glance. You get the profile image with the description of it, their banner, a nice big follow button and all the adjunct information like the location, website and the date they signed up/number of tweets per day below it. Using the @ in the corner you can tweet the person. The menu in the top right allows you to set a number of settings for the user which I quite liked, including the ability to set color and nicknames for the person.

Oddly enough, you can get the number of times a person has tweeted until you scroll down a bit.  

### Composing a tweet

![Composing  tweet is easy with Twidere](/images/twidere/compose.png){: .vertical}

As you'll notice from the screenshots, Twidere uses an [FAB](https://dribbble.com/shots/2090619-Material-Design-The-FAB) which opens up the tweet composition area, meaning you can always tweet easily[^3] within reach of your thumb, my phone is 5 inches but I can still reach it easily[^4]. You can add your location with a single tap on the location bar if that is your kind of thing, and tweeting from multiple accounts is easy. If you tweet with an image from another app, then the background of the tweet becomes the image. Otherwise, the image just goes below the words

If a tweet is not or cannot be sent, either to you exiting the tweet composition area or lack of a connection to send the tweet then the tweet will be placed into the drafts area, allowing for easy editing or resending at a later date.

For the rapid fire tweeter, you can replace the Google Now action to have the compose section of Twidere pop up. Personally, I have hardly any use for this because:

1. I am hardly away from my laptop, and Vivaldi has the super awesome [web panels](https://twitter.com/ManOTheClassics/status/695546190079766529) which is kind of easier to use.
2. I use [Nova Launcher](http://novalauncher.com/) on my phone, which I have set up so two fingers turning clockwise triggers Twidere to open.

Still, saying its a useless feature would be incredibly harsh on them. It's useful, just not for me. 

### Filters

Twidere can also filter out content as needed, just like most other tweeting applications. You can filter by users, keywords, sources and page links. 

In a test, I filtered out dogs, ocean and the URL ```muo.fm```. Here's what I got:

Which would be really helpful for when... [those](http://www.candlerblog.com/2015/12/14/film-twitter-slack/) types of situations. 

### Get on tweeting

If I'm being honest, I haven't really tried a lot of other twitter clients for Android, mostly because all the good ones cost money. Yes yes, I do want to try some of the paid ones but the cost of them[^5]. Anyway, if you're looking for a nice, free, modern twitter client for Android then I'd say go no further than Twidere. It's pretty freaking awesome.
