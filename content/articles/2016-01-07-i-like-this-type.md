I recently finished Tim Winton's *In the Winter Dark* and, on top of being a great read, it has a nice typographic design I like. It's very short, only 136 pages and finished in a day. The font was of course, a serif[^1] but what I liked most was how new chapters and paragraphs where begun.

New chapters are told with most of the page blank, save for the bottom fifth or sixth. The first letter of each is a big drop[^2] cap, with a height of four lines, leaving only space for one or two lines below it. New paragraphs/when the perspective of the novel changes from one character to another is told with a similar drop cap, only smaller, about two lines high.

There are also several dream/flashback sequences in the book, usually each of these is a paragraph in its own. And the first letter is not a drop letter, instead it is normal size. A nice way to denote if its a dream sequence or not.

It's an awesome book,  the fact I read it in a day should help prove that. But I couldn't help but notice I not only liked the writing, but the type design of the book. It gave it a certain uniqueness I haven't been able to find before, and I enjoyed it. Weird aren't I? Enjoying a book for its type(face).

[^1]: Come to think of it, it's hard to think of a book that *doesn't* have serifs in it. It's obvious why, serifs allow for easier reading of text, at least in book format.

[^2]: Here's [some example's of drop caps](http://www.dailydropcap.com/), although these are a bit quirky. Can't say I don't like them.
