> <p>When hacker group Impact Team released the Ashley Madison data, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/comments/3h71ar/we_are_the_impact_team_we_are_releasing_the/">they asserted that “thousands” of the women’s profiles were fake</a>. Later, this number <a href="http://tampa.cbslocal.com/2015/08/19/ashley-madison-hackers/">got blown up in news stories</a> that asserted <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/08/20/my_fake_ashley_madison_affair_someone_else_used_my_email_address_to_create_an_account_so_why_do_i_feel_so_guilty/">“90-95%” of them were fake</a>, though nobody put forth any evidence for such an enormous number. So I downloaded the data and analyzed it to find out how many actual women were using Ashley Madison, and who they were.</p>

> <p>What I discovered was that the world of Ashley Madison was a far more dystopian place than anyone had realized. This isn’t a debauched wonderland of men cheating on their wives. It isn’t even a sadscape of 31 million men competing to attract those 5.5 million women in the database. Instead, it’s like a science fictional future where every woman on Earth is dead, and some Dilbert-like engineer has replaced them with badly-designed robots.</p>

I would be amazed if there were more then just desperate men using the site.
