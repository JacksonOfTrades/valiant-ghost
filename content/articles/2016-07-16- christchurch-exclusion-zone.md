As some of you may know, five years ago an earthquake ripped through and destroyed a big part of Christchurch. And at the center is an area known as the Residential Red Zone, a part of the town that was so badly destroyed that there is just empty space where some of the houses had to be demolished, peppered with still standing houses. 

The houses that survive are either abandoned or, just like in Chernobyl, some are still lived in by people. And also just like Chernobyl, the plots of lands abanonded by humanity have been taken back by nature. The obvious signs that humanity once stood there is a seemingly empty field is divived into lanes by obviously human planted trees, and Bus stops standing in front of nothing, derelict and unused as the buses never come by anymore. And at the state of the roads it's not hard to see why. 

The houses that are not abandoned have the rather creepy message "We still live here" written on their front for the papers to know that they are not just abandoned derelicts. Why do people still live in such an area? For some it's because of the fact they are their homes, owned for decades by them and no matter what they are not leaving. It is just like Chernobyl, only you can go there with little to no danger to you.
