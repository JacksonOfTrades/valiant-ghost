Aaron Paul Calvin at Digg:

> Before the ubiquity of Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter, games like *RuneScape* — with its open chat rooms and virtual meeting places — let kids who had access to a computer, but not a car, hang out with friends and, sometimes, make new ones. The game’s various quests and gameplay forced you to play and interact with these friends and strangers. The subsequent mayhem that would result, virtual or not, was just an entertaining way to spend time with other humans — silly and open ended but almost always consequence free. You could attempt a serious quest or, more often than not, just goof around. A favorite pastime was seeing how far you could get into the then unregulated Wilderness before being hunted down by a more experienced player.


> Several iterations of the game have been released over the years, the most popular of which is *RuneScape 2*, released in 2004 and, based on player opinion, peaked in 2007. The game remained essentially the same until the[2013 release](http://www.pcgamer.com/runescape-3-release-date-announced-major-mmo-upgrade-due-end-of-july/) of *RuneScape 3*, with an HTML5 revamp that offered upgraded playability and visuals.


> This is now the default version of the game, with a more streamlined focus than the previous version. While the landscape of *RuneScape 3* is more detailed than *RuneScape 2*, it’s still dated by modern standards. The quests and the narrative of the original *RuneScape* are still there, but the inter-player interaction is limited at the beginning of the game — alienating newer players from the wider *RuneScape* community. Overall, the game is less open-ended and, with upgraded graphics but the same point-and-click controls, it feels more like playing a PlayStation 2 game with poor control design than an expansive MMORPG. The rough edges have been smoothed, making it arguably even easier for new players to pick up and play, but the unvarnished charm of the old *RuneScape* has been polished away.

And later:

> Despite Jagex claiming that the Bonds system was met enthusiastically by the community, the company still needed to do something to win back the players they had lost with the Wilderness and trade changes from 2007. Their solution? Simply introduce a separate version of the game as it existed in its golden years. The result was *Old School* *RuneScape* (OSRS).

*Moslty irrelevant commentary follows*

Ah yes, Runescape. The game I also poured so many hours into in 2007-2008 after a friend introduced me to it.  In that game I have so many memories, I made good friends and of course I made enemies, I got hacked and got my account back, I was harassed time and time again by people asking for my password, I farmed for hours to get enough hide to sell for a lot of gold, I cried whenever I died and lost my gear and it was the game that made my parents finally put a limit on the amount of time I could play a video.

But what I remember most was that I was scammed in that game for a lot of gold and some *really* good armor. I never forgot the moment I realised that online people could lie and steal and cheat, and that this could be true in the real world. 

Did the game teach me a life lesson? Perhaps it did. I might have to try out Old School Runescape at some point, just to relive the nostalgia of the time. Maybe I'll get scammed again!

Now I wonder if I can remember my old password...
