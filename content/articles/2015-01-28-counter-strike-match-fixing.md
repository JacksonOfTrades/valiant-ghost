>Valve said its investigation found that "a substantial number of high-valued items won from that match," were transferred to members of both teams by the person who placed the bets, Duc "cud" Pham. The Daily Dot reported it had text messages from one of the banned players, Derek "dboorn" Boorn, saying he would be getting "about $7,000 worth of skins" in his Steam account on the day of the match in question.

Does this make it a real sport now?
