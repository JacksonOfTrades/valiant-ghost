Mike Lacher, McSweeny:

<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">

Listen up. I know the shit you’ve been saying behind my back. You think I’m stupid. You think I’m immature. You think I’m a malformed, pathetic excuse for a font. Well think again, nerdhole, because I’m Comic Sans, and I’m the best thing to happen to typography since Johannes fucking Gutenberg.

</span>

May I never again have to use ```<span style= "font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">``` on this site ever again.

Update: Well that didn't work. The quoted text was originally meant to be comic sans but for some reason the span style wouldn't work. ```:/```
