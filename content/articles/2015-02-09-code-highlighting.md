I recently found this awesome code highlighter, which I'm now using on this site. Cool eh? Not only does it look better (to me anyway) than Octopress' default Solarized highlighting, but its small (Only 2kb) and really customizable! If you're looking for a nice code highlighter for your site, I'd recommend you check it out.

If you're using Octopress like me (although I am debating whether to move to Middleman, although Middleman seems to have no advantage over Octopress for now) then you can use [this](https://github.com/gmurphey/jekyll-prism-plugin) handy little plugin. It took me a while, but seems to work.

Update 2/9/15: Funny looking back at this as to when I was on the fence about Middleman, when I now use it.
