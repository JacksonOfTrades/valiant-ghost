Sean O'Kane, writing for The Verge:

> ... astronomer Phil Plait noticed a clue in a recent episode that might reframe the entire debate. In "The Musk Who Fell to Earth," Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gazes out of the Simpsons' dining room window at a waxing crescent moon. The only problem is that, in the northern hemisphere the "tips" of a waxing crescent moon should be pointing to the left, not to the right like in the episode. Plait says this can mean only one thing: The Simpsons takes place in the southern hemisphere.
