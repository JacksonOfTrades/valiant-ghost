William Herkewitz, Popular Mechanics:

> A team of Harvard scientists led by geneticist Seth Shipman has just developed a fascinating way to write chunks information into the genetic code of living, growing bacterial cells. It could be the code for a computer program or the lines of a poem. Either way, these living memory sticks can pass this data onto their descendants, and scientists can later read that data by genotyping the bacteria. As Shipman explains in [a paper today in the journal *Science*](http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaf1175), his method can upload roughly 100 bytes of data.



> To be clear, scientists have already proven they can synthetically manufacture DNA in the lab and write into it pretty much whatever they want, including [a full-length book on science](http://planetsave.com/2012/08/18/text-of-a-full-book-encoded-in-dna/). "But working within a living cell is an entirely different story and challenge," says Shipman. "Rather than synthesizing DNA and cutting it into a living cell, we wanted to know if we could use nature's own methods to write directly onto the genome of a bacterial cell, so it gets copied and pasted into every subsequent generation."
