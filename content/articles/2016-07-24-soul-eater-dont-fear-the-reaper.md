Oh boy, my second Article over at Fighting for Nippon, this time about how [Death in Soul Eater helps us embrace death](http://fightingfornippon.com/soul-eater-dont-fear-reaper/)... Depressing I know:

> *Soul Eater* teaches us that one day we will die.

> … Hey! Hey! Come back to this article! I swear it’s not going to be so morbid throughout. I’m sorry but it’s true, as human beings, it is ascertained we will one day depart from this world and (depending on your view) a skeleton, in a black robe and carrying a scythe will help us through to wherever we need to go. He’s the Reaper, a literal personification of death.

> And it is this personification that we place our fear of dying. We run and hide, but the Reaper Man will always find us. So why do we fear him? If you do believe in going to the next life, wouldn’t you rather have someone there to help you? Death – The bloke with the robes and scythe, not the concept – has been given the old humorous treatment before by Terry Pratchett in his *Discworld* series of novels, and so does the manga and anime series *Soul Eater*, with Lord Death as one of the main characters. And using literally Death as one of the main and most powerful characters in the series, *Soul Eater* rather cleverly asks us to do exactly the same as what Blue Öyster Cult asked us to do in the 70’s: *“Baby don’t Fear the Reaper”*.
