Here's a techno version of Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't fear the Reaper." Rather than being jerky and out of place, the song translates well over to the modern electric side.

Also, why do people fear the reaper? Maybe my view may have been skewed by Soul Eater and Terry Pratchett, but the reaper actually seems like a cool guy at his core. All he's there to do is help you to whatever is next for you, whether that be heaven or hell, which to me is better than going alone.
