> If you have a kid, why not run experiments on them? Itâ€™s like running experiments on a little clone of yourself! And almost always probably legal.

I'm not sure whether that is evil or hilarious[^1].

Either way, its interesting the result it had on the kid. He doesn't want Call of Duty like every other 10 year old, he only wants games that are fun and challenging.  And seemingly all of them have retro graphics.

I guess it goes to show brainwashing a kid from an early age *does* work. If you know, you ignore ethics.
