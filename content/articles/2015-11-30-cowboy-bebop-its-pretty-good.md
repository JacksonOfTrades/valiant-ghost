> 2071: In the far flung-future, the universe is still expanding. Bounty hunters, gathering in the spaceship "BEBOP", will play their own game freely without fear of risk. They must create new dreams by breaking traditional styles. We must create new films by doing the same. The work, which becomes a new genre unto itself, will be called "COWBOY BEBOP".

One of the main reasons a lot of people seem to like the original Star Wars compared to the newer ones[^1] is they like the setting. A used future, with all the gleam and shine of the future imagined by the fifties gone and replaced with dust and grime that makes it seem like a more believable world, rather than a concept. *Cowboy Bebop* is no Star Wars by any means, but it captures the tune, the aesthetic of Star Wars, gives us music that is similarly awesome and  presents to us a very mature story in a very goofy way.

Cowboy Bebop takes place in the year 2071[^2] and follows the isolated adventures of the bounty hunters about the spaceship Bebop: Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward and their corgi Ein. Each episode[^3] generally follows this format: starts on the Bebop with the hungry, starving and crew that’s resentful of each other → said crew gets a bounty → episode involves the crew trying to get the bounty while learning something (sometimes) → they don't get the bounty for some reason or another → repeat ad infinitum. Its formulaic and rarely do consequences carry over into the next episode, but it works, you could watch most of these episodes in a random order and you would miss out on nearly no plot, save for four episodes that are titles part 1 and part 2. Nearly all episodes are good and unique, *Brain Scratch* provides an interesting social commentary, *Mushroom Samba* give us a family friendly *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* feel as the crew gets stoned on mushrooms and *Toys in the Attic* provides a feeling akin to Alien, alone with something on a ship in space. There are some which are worse than others, like *Boogie Woogie Feng Shui* could be done without, but like I said you doesn't really matter which order you watch them in much.

If I could say only one good thing about this show, it would be the sound. The soundtrack is top notch, 1940's noir jazz which perfectly enhances the space western setting complete with a sax theme that sets it. Every time a gun is fired it sounds like it was pulled from *The Good, The Bad and The Ugly* a sound less like the explosion of gunpowder and more like a laser firing. Under any other circumstance this may be annoying, but in following a western theme Cowboy Bebop does well to remember this sound and use it well. 

Stylistically the colors are big and vibrant, from Spike's purple suit and green hair to the places frequented by the crew to find their bounties. This compliments the characters themselves, big explosive personalities. Places often have an Asian theme to them, but this does well as the anime is similar to the Hong Kong cinema in its style direction. The characters themselves are all unique and interesting with each one having a different backstory to them.

But you'd be mistaken for thinking this is some kind of family friendly show. It’s an anime that you go into expecting it to be a goofy funny romp about bounty hunters through space and come out with a smile. In reality you come out with a blank expression thinking *'Well shit'* and have to go contemplate your life for an hour or so based on the ending. I could go into more detail to this, but this is not the type of piece to discuss that without spoilers. Cowboy Bebop remains one of the definitive anime's of our generation for a reason and if you need an anime to watch I'd definitely suggest you watch this.

10/10.
