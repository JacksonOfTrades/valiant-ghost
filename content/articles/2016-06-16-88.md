Question: Wouldn't Archer (Fate/Stay Night) going back in time to kill himself pretty much do some [grandfather paradox](https://valiantghost.com/2016/05/grandfather-paradox/) style thing, where he would still be condemned to the existance his younger self created with his ideals no matter what he did?
