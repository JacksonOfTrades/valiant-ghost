There you are, minding your own business when suddenly ***BIG SHINY RED BUTTON!*** You want to press it. You need to press it. Every compulsion in your body is demanding your index finger depresses it, consequences be damned.

So... why? Why do we see this big, forbidden thing and instantly want to go and press it? Gizmodo has the answer for us!

> In general, the more we’re told not to do something, the more we want to do that thing. In pop culture, it’s tied to the Big Red Button in beyond, with such tropes as “<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Fruit</a>,” “<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuriosityKilledTheCast">Curiosity Killed the Cast</a>,” and “<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">Do Not Do This Cool Thing</a>.” In psychology, this can be explained by reactance theory, which says that if our freedom of choice is threatened, we feel compelled to protect that freedom, making us want the taboo thing even more. It’s been used to study the relatively high drinking age in America, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8189723">which has been found</a> to promote illegal, underage drinking in college students.


> As far as buttons go, buttons equal power. Press one, and something always happens. In the real world, rarely is that “something” negative. Often, it’s summoning something, or someone. The call button on an airplane, or a doorbell. We want to press buttons because we think it’ll help us achieve or obtain something. And when we’re told *not* to press a button, some people find it hard to resist the urge. It’s human nature.
