Laying in the bath, typing in paragraphs into my phone which will hopefully one day form a cohesive narrative of an article for Fighting For Nippon, and all I can think about is Douglas Adams doing the exact same during a time before I was even born with a Psion 5 [^1], writing about laying in the bath typing on this new fangled machine he had[^3]. 

I wonder what he would think today about Mac's[^2], the state of Apple today and the fact we all carry around little computers smaller and a million times more powerful than his Psion 5. Would he be in amazement of tablets and iPhone's, and of Pokemon Go? Or would he scoff at it and instead do what George R.R. Martin does: Write on an old [DOS writing program](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/05/14/george_r_r_martin_writes_on_dos_based_wordstar_4_0_software_from_the_1980s.html) (Or the equivalent, like a word processor from the 90's). Ah well, I guess we'll never know.



[^1]: A device I really, really want by the way, no matter how ineffective it may be in real life. 

[^2]: He apparently loved his old MacBook, back when they were still called Macintosh. 

[^3]: From [The Salmon of Doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salmon_of_Doubt), which, like most of the books I own, I picked up at a second hand store after accidentily buying the Lord of the Rings again. (Again is a story for another time)
