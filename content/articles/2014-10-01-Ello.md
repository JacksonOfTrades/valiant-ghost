So, if you've got Facebook or anything like that then chances are you've heard about Ello, a new social network that is calling itself 'Anti-Facebook.'

I am personally interested to see what happens here, a social networking site thrives or dies based on it's userbase, so I will be interested whether it truly rises to be a 'Facebook-killer' or if it will just fade into obscurity.

Personally, I'm not a fan of it's monochrome colour scheme, a bit of colour would be nice here or there. And apparently its buggy as hell.
