Usually in an Anime the hero will face a villain at some point to find out they're not strong enough to kill the villain easily, so they need a tactic/long drawn out fight/power up to best them, which they inevitably do in some big, flashy, epic battle. But what if a hero wasn't like that, where all it took was one blow, with no flash, no epicness, no build up, just a single blow? This is what One Punch Man is. He is exactly what it says on the tin. He can kill villains with only a single punch. 

I get the immediate impression One Punch Man is meant to parody other popular superhero anime. The very first villain we see is an obvious take on a Dragon Ball Z villain. After the monster kills numerous other heroes who try to stop him, its up to OPM man to kill him. And how does he do this? Not with skill, or a badass Super Saiyan transformation. But with one punch. ONE. PUNCH. And after this, he expresses annoyance in the fact it only took one Punch to kill the villain.

One Punch Man himself is a very plain looking hero, an expressionless face, a bald egg shaped head, and a plain 50's superman costume and huge gloves. It's implied that he wears this plain outfit because there is literally no challenge to him any more, and he's bald because he trained so hard his hair fell out. 

The music and sound effects are all very cliche anime Japanese, again probably meaning to parody other anime.

The basic premise is interesting enough, what happens when a hero gets too powerful. I'll be interested to see where it goes from here, especially with its anime parody feel. Overall, One Punch Man left a good first impression on me, and I'll be interested to see how it turns out.
