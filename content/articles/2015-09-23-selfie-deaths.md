Helena Horton on The Telegraph:

> There have been twelve recorded selfie deaths in 2015 so far, compared to eight people dying because of shark attacks.

>Most of the selfie-related deaths have been due to falling. The next most common is when people are trying to take a selfie, and they're hit by a moving vehicle.
