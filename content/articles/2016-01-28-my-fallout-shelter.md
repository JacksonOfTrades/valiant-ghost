When Fallout Shelter was announced at E3, my first thought was “Where's the Android version?”

And so I watched for any news of the android version. And waited. Like a hawk. 

Only a few hours after it was released, I downloaded it straight to my phone.

Oh boy were those first few weeks brutal. Trust me, on your first few times playing Fallout Shelter you think it will be a milk run, a very simple Fallout mobile game, like [Tiny Tower](https://itunes.apple.com/app/tiny-tower/id422667065?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). And it's not. It's really, really hard. 

But five months later, and I finally have a Vault which can actually sustain itself with little to no effort or rushing the room. Actually, more than just sustain itself, it over supplies for itself. So there's not much for me to do...

Other than write about it here. 

### Welcome to Vault 7

*It was originally Vault 42 but that didn't go well. Neither did Vault 42b. Anyway...*

*Vault 7, a Vault located right in the heart of Wyoming. Providing for all your necessities, you can live comfortably underground in the event of a nuclear war. Nuclear Winter is cold. Stay warm in Vault 7.*

It took me a couple of failed play through’s until I started to learn the value of **power**. There are three resources in the game, food, water and power. Obviously the dwellers of your Vault need food and water to survive. The rooms which give your dwellers food and water, run on power. When I started the game, I focused most on the food and water rooms. Obviously, too many food and water rooms led to not enough power rooms which meant the food and water rooms couldn't run. In the style of a snake biting its own tale, my Vault, well two Vaults, failed. 

So if you want a Vault to survive, ***Lots of power rooms***. Here's my layout.

I have a lot of power rooms, especially on the first few levels. Not only does this have been advantage of providing lots of power, but brings us to our next section...[^1]

### When the wasteland attacks

I have a Super Reactor, the upgraded power room, on the very first floor across from my upgraded Vault door. My strongest dwellers go there for this reason:

![DEATHCLAWS!](/images/fshelter/image3.png) 

Yes, Deathclaw’s. The horrors of the wastes coming into your Vault need to be stopped as soon as possible. Which means the top floors(s). 

The top level has a power room, which works best with Strength dwellers, meaning that they're the toughest dwellers that could possibly be. The best weapons and the best armor. I don't bother with a guard at the door to my Vault, as the two there would just get slaughtered, as opposed to the six they would run into this way. 

These, for all intents and purposes are the Vault Defence force. But it's important not just to defend.

### The Exploration Force

You explore outside the Vault too. To contribute to the main wealth and treasure of the Vault, like getting new weapons and armor, I suggest you establish an **Exploration Force**.  For me, there are four ‘main’ hunters for this Vault. They are:

#### Alexander Perry, The Pimp

![Image](/images/fshelter/perry.png)

One of the original dwellers of the Vault, he was once sent out because of his inability to fit any roll I needed of him. And on that trip he found Eugenes suit[^2] and a golden rocket launcher. Obviously, with the suit and such a innuendo-ous weapon, it was inevitable I would name him ** 'The Pimp'**

#### Rose Anderson, The Doc

![Image](/images/fshelter/rose.png)

She doesn't really heal... Not much you can help with a plasma rifle. 

#### Mildred Grant, The Librarian

![Image](/images/fshelter/mildred.png) 

She got her clothing out on a run once, combined with her high intelligence made her a natural in the Science Building. I like to imagine she calls her plasma rifle the 'Overdue Book Fine'. Because you know, librarian. 

#### Christopher Pratt, The Classy Motherfucker

![Image](/images/fshelter/pratt.png)

I can't remember if he actually came with this name or if I changed it, but he was the first and only person in the Vault to find a Gatling laser and power armor. He originally rolled in a suit with his Gatling laser, giving him his nickname. Plus, he’s got a kitty! All Classy Motherfucker's have kitty’s!

### And now for my psychotic tendencies

And now for the [dark part](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault) of a Vault 7; if you want in, you've got to prove yourself. 

When I first started Fallout Shelter, I wasn't picky about who I let in. You were put into whatever job suited your SPECIAL stats best. But now, that I'm self-sustainable I am pickier. You can be let *in* no matter what, but staying is another matter. If a dwellers has above 3 special in any field, they can stay. Otherwise they must face the gauntlet of the wastes/

No weapons or armor. Three Stimpaks. Three Radways. It they want to come back, they need to find some useful gear out in the wastes. If not well… you can guess what happens. 

Yes, it's sadistic. But what else my I supposed to do? Train them? Takes too much time off valuable work they could be doing. Plus it adds extra power cost which I hardly need in my Vault. 

Or you know, I'm just too lazy.

### Hard Work is Happy Work!

This game is *really* hard to get into and to have your Vault survive you need a strategy. But if you learn from my mistakes then you should be able to get a working Vault, you should be able to turn the hard work you have to put in initially into happy work later in the game.

I'm not really sure how much longer I can draw out this game, as I'm pretty much set for now. My goal currently is to get every piece of armor and weapon in the game, just for the Pokémon-esque satisfaction of having everything and fulfilling my hoarder obsession in games like these. For all the early game brutality its really fun.

And I'll keep playing until Vault 7 has every piece of gear under the sun. At which case I'll log off/resign as Overseer and let my Vault work away happily. Because after all:

Hard Work is Happy Work!

[^1]: Oh, and the odd little power room that's detached from the rest of the Vault. Originally there were SPECIAL training rooms there but it took too much power, and the extra power room couldn't provide enough. So I removed the training rooms and left the power room there.
