*Preface:*

On a recent flight, I may have had one to many coffees, giving me a damn caffeine of high of nuclear proportions. 

I began writing, like writing anything new was going to be banned. Not in the Nazi *"Burn the Books! We'll make our own books! With Blackjack and Hookers!"* kind of way, but in the way that any new, original writing was to become a cardinal sin. 

So, I present to you: The Coffee Log, a sprawling number of writings written in hand, about a number of things like flying, love, [Gonzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism), jokes, my own life. So sit back and read what is pretty much the closest thing you will get to Drunk Writing here on Valiant Ghost.
