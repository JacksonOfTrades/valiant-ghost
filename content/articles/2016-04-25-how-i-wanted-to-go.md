> Y'know, this is how I wanted to go out. Surrounded in the corpses of my enemies, next to my Senpai, looking up at the night sky. And now to fire a 12 gun salute for myself.

Me playing [Left 4 Dead 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/550/). I got this in 2013 through a Steam gift, and I've only just started playing it. And if you haven't, then you bloody well should start. With mods you can turn it into either an anime lovers dream or a giant monstrosity. Very few games I've found let you play as [Ruby](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451484416) from RWBY, wielding the [Keyblade](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136843552) whilst fighting alongside [Alucard](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=324481807) who has [Excalibur](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567718885) from the Fate series. And then you hear [AWOLNATIONS *Run* so you know there's a Tank coming](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=669148644), which is not what you bloody need right now. And then, against the odds you and your team make it to the safe room. And what do you hear? [*This is how we do it. La la la la la. This is how we do it.*](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656886478)
