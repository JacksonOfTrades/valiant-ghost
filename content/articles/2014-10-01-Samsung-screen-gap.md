>A small gap appears around the outside of the device case… This gap is a necessary manufacturing feature and some minor rocking or vibration of parts may occur… Over time, friction between parts may cause this gap to expand slightly.

They do realise things such as sand, dust and the like can fit in the gap? At least put tape or something over it, don't just have a hole in the side of a phone!
