Discovery:

> Because each head has its own brain, the two halves can move independently, and Nanning Zoo experts say the two heads often come together, as if they are going to fight. But scientists there say that's because the typical cobra will move in an "S" shape, and the two heads will naturally butt.

I do seriously wonder what the movement-to-headbutt frequency is. It is every movement? Every fifth movement?
