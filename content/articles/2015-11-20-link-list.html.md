So, I've kind of been thinking for a while I should actually write a weekly column here so that its not just randomly scheduled come as they are links.  There might be more to come, but for now heres my attempt at a weekly column, In Case You Missed It... where basically the plan is to put the stuff I link on twitter here with some of the usual Valiant Ghost commentary.

Sometimes I link things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ManOTheClassics) instead of here. Why? Often because I'm either too lazy, busy[^1] or it just doesn't really fit the *feel* of Valiant Ghost, even though there isn't really one[^2]. Even though I have more twitter followers than regular readers on this site, I'm pretty sure most of the people following me are bots. So, without further ado, here is the first installment of In Case you Missed it...

#### [If browsers were anime characters](http://rosel-d.deviantart.com/art/Browser-tan-512912848)

It fits rather nicely, Internet Explorer looks all shy from being rejected as the default browser all the time, Chrome looks like an old jaded professional, Firefox looking like the browser the cool kids use. I love it.

#### [The Oscar Gamble Virus](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3slfzl/tifu_by_testing_some_code/)

From reddits TIFU (Today I Fucked Up) subreddit comes this little gem. Don't run your code in production, kids... actually never run your code in production, no matter what age you are.

#### [Why Adults Fall In Love With Anime Characters](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2015/06/12/why-adults-fall-in-love-and-spend-big-money-on-cartoon-characters/)

Lauren Orsini writing for Forbes:

> Chang Kim loves Asuna, a honey-blonde beauty who is great with a sword.

> “She’s a good cook, good with kids, and she knows how to fend for herself. There’s not much else I could ask for,” the 20-year-old student from Georgia says of the woman he calls his “waifu.”

> Asuna isn’t a real woman, but that doesn’t matter to Kim, who has spent about $500 of his grocery cashier’s salary on merchandise depicting his 2D sweetheart. From resin figures to body pillows—huggable oversized pillows with life size images of an anime character on them—the industry is banking on people like Kim being unable to resist products that market one special character.

MY WAIFU!


#### [Pornhub's traffic dropped by 10 precent the day Fallout 4 came out ](http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/13/pornhubs-traffic-dipped-significantly-the-day-fallout-4-came-out/)

Jeff Grubb, writing for Venture Beat:

> Pornhub, one of the world’s most popular adult video sites, told GamesBeat that it saw a 10 percent drop in traffic among gamers after Fallout 4 came out earlier this week. On November 10, traffic started to drop at around 5 a.m. after most people finished downloading and installing the game. That decrease from normal patterns continued until around 3 p.m. Gamers then seemed to disappear again beginning at 6 p.m.

> “We can’t say we’re too surprised with what happened to our traffic during peak gaming hours,” Pornhub vice president Corey Price told GamesBeat. “Based on the data, it looks like a huge surge of people decided to indulge in some wasteland wandering by taking the day off of work and school to play, while the rest of the world had to wade through what we assume were the longest hours of work ever in anticipation of some alone time with their consoles.”

Clearly people have their priorities. Also, if you spotted the typo I made that in the tweet, so it feels like I should keep it there.

#### [The many (type) faces of ¯\_(ツ)_/¯](https://medium.com/@txtype/the-many-type-faces-of-%E3%83%84-86c8547a40b4#.mwa1jej4q)

Trent Thompson:

> For some time now, I’ve wanted to show off the differentiating characteristics between typefaces. Making it so that anyone can easily grasp those differences and have it be a bit fun. Now, that’s quite a tall order. Typically people don’t usually pay much attention to typefaces as a designer might, which is totally fine. So just recently, I saw this tweet from Indra Kupferschmid…

So I've learned this didn't link correctly in the tweet. It does here, I made sure and checked it. In case you're wondering, the above ```¯\_(ツ)_/¯``` was in Merriweather and the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ you just read was in Source Sans Pro.

Anyway, here you learn how ```¯\_(ツ)_/¯``` looks in many different fonts. In certain type faces sometimes doesn't show up. On reddit, the type face used seems to cut the left arm off, leaving a floating Rayman hand. It also doesn't work in the markdown preview of the application I'm using to write this.

Eyebleach anyone?


#### [Funnily enough, I read this in bed](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34744859)

TL;DR Phones seriously do need a night mode.

#### [Sharks love death metal](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzCbsw3WgTk>)

Sharks are the ultimate metalheads. I mean, how could they not be. FREAKING LOOK AT THEM!

#### [Asteroid Mining? ASTEROID MINING!](http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/gares/ARES_34_68E.pdf)

So, if you're an American citizen and own a spaceship and the mining equipment you can now legally mine asteroid. Lucky you.

#### [F.lux has been removed from the app store](http://recode.net/2015/11/16/apple-tells-screen-dimming-software-f-lux-to-shut-down-its-ios-version/)

Real shame, I use F.lux on my PC and its a really nice thing to have for late night coding/reading/redditing. 

#### [What that plate under your coffee cup is actually for](http://en.ilovecoffee.jp/posts/view/83)

Yeah, its not just to carry the little marshmallow and spoon, apparently.

#### [There's a subreddit for everything... including your people needing you](https://www.reddit.com/r/MyPeopleNeedMe/)

The 'my people need me joke' is from the Simpsons Poochy episode. It ends with Poochy flying off screen saying "I must go, my people need me". The more you know.

#### [Pip-Boy in CSS](http://codepen.io/stix/full/KdJEwB/)

I envy those with the skills and patience to make this. I would probably go insane before I even got to the screen.

#### [The Big Rad Wolf](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ahava516/22369269938/)

Lets shred those waves like the carcass of an animal we just hunted.

...And it gets worse

#### [Foundation 6 released](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html)

Sweet! I love Foundation 5 for making other peoples websites, and it looks like Foundation 6 will be even better. 

[^1]: I don't really like linking without leaving any commentary. It just feels lazy to link and not write anything myself.

[^2]: It's all over the place. I might go into anime blogging soon. Maybe.
