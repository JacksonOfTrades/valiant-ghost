Writer [Jason O. Gilbert](http://www.jasonogilbert.com/) has created a rather inventive little horror story made entirely of attention-grabbing headlines from the [Weather.com](https://weather.com/) website.

> [They gathered at the beach by the thousands for a chance to see it](http://www.weather.com/series/great-outdoors/video/annual-houston-sandcastle-competition-in-galveston-texas).


> [It was spotted dozens of miles from the storm](http://www.weather.com/news/weather/video/mammatus-clouds-found-north-of-storm-near-chicago). [They hadn’t seen anything like it](http://adstest.climate.weather.com/outlook/weather-news/news/articles/texas-dust-storm_2011-10-18); [it hadn’t happened like this in the last 1,000 years](http://www.weather.com/news/news/1934-drought-worst-millennium-dust-bowl-20141020). [It’s floating off the coast and it could be toxic or explosive](http://www.weather.com/science/space/news/spacex-falcon9-explosion-debris).


> [The military is worried about it, and you should be, too](http://weather.climate25.com/project/general-charles-h-jacoby-ret/).


> [A map confirmed what scientists feared](http://www.weather.com/science/environment/news/record-warm-year-2014-earth-0): [The strange sight isn’t all it seems](http://www.weather.com/news/news/why-is-moon-orange-over-midwest-and-southeast). [It is growing bigger and more toxic](http://www.weather.com/news/video/poison-ivy-growing-bigger-more-toxic); [it only takes seconds for it to explode](http://www.weather.com/science/space/news/space-shuttle-challenger-weather-role). [Officials are worried about the potential for catastrophe](http://www.weather.com/news/news/wildfire-season-2015).


> [And you thought you only had to fear sharks at the beach](http://www.weather.com/series/great-outdoors/video/fisherman-pulls-gator-out-of-beach-at-pawleys-island-south-carolina).

They all link to headlines, and it keeps going.
