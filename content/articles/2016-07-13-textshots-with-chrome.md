Every since I learned about Textshots[^1] I've wanted a way to do it on my devices, but the ability has been lacking for Android and Windows, reserved mostly for iPhone's. Lo and behold, today I open up my RSS feed to see [The Next Web has written](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2016/07/13/chirp-chrome-best-tool-tweeting-quotes-articles/) about an extension for Chrome (And by extension, Vivaldi[^2]) called [Chirp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chirp-for-twitter/mlocpcjojbacdcajmjmlfonfibnleede), which does exactly that. 

[Here's the first textshot I ever made, and I love it so far](https://twitter.com/ManOTheClassics/status/753146209775161344). Of course I did it for my [own article at Fighting For Nippon](http://fightingfornippon.com/kill-alucard-humanity-hellsing/). Hopefully many more to come.
