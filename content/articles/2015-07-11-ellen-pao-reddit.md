Mike Isaac, New York Times,

> Ellen Pao became a hero to many when she took on the entrenched male-dominated culture of Silicon Valley. But sentiment is a fickle thing. Late Friday she fell victim to a crowd demanding [her ouster](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/) as chief executive of the popular social media site Reddit.

>...

> More than 213,000 people signed a petition demanding Ms. Pao’s resignation. After her departure was announced, Reddit users celebrated in an over-the-top fashion. “Rejoice internet brethren,” wrote one. “The great evil has been slain.”

The official reddit announcement post of [Pao's resignation and the return of Steve Huffman](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/), original CEO of reddit currently has 48 gildings at the time of writing. Just how childish can you get?
