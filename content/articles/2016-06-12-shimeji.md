Thanks to [this /r/saber reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Saber/comments/38id10/shimeji_saber_itll_make_your_life_brighter/) I now have six[^1] of the adorable thingy's known as Shimeji crawling all over my screen, being adorable while they do. While some may be distracted by the constant movement all over their screen screen, I quite enjoy seeing them all move around in their own unique ways ways. I got most of my Shimeji's from Deviantart, although I may cut it down to just Saber and Sebastian, as they are both the best done.

[^1]: Or it would be six if they didn't keep going through cell division and creating more of themselves. I currently have four young Walter's and two Saber's crawling around my screen.
