Chad Orzel, *Forbes*: 

> Rhett points out that we’ve known for several centuries now that our eyes don’t emit anything, just receive light from outside. So for Superman to be using real X-rays to see, there would need to be some external source producing them, which just doesn’t happen.


> Of course, there’s an even bigger problem with this, namely that the optics are all wrong. Even if there were a convenient source of x-rays around that Superman could use to illuminate whatever he’s trying to see through, humanoid eyes are not put together in a way that would work to make x-ray images. While in one sense, x-rays are just extremely high-frequency light, in practical terms working with x-rays is nothing at all like working with ordinary visible light.

Surprisingly, the flying aliens laser eyes don't work.
