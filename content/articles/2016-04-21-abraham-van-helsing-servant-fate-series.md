I've been playing a lot of Fate/Grand Order recently, which among [giving me some ideas about myself](/2016/04/the-strange-case-of-fgo-hyde-ocd/), has left me with some thoughts about who could potentially be added as a servant, not just to the game but the series in general. And considering characters [from](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Gilgamesh) [books](http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Henry_Jekyll_%26_Hyde) [are](http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Beowulf) [free](http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Edmond_Dantes) [game](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Assassin_(Fate/Grand_Order_-_Phantom)) I would love to see [Abraham Van Helsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Van_Helsing) from Bram Stoker's [Dracula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula) be added.

Servants can be summoned in multiple classes depending on what they're remembered as, and depending on the class they can have different personalities and appearances. Take [Vlad the Impaler](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Vlad_III), who Bram Stoker based Dracula on, can be summoned as either a Lancer, as the Impaler, or Berserker, as Dracula. If Vlad is summoned as Lancer he despises his connection to Dracula and tries to be as different from that image as possible, while if summoned as Berserker he is more in line with the image of Dracula.

Helsing could also play on this. If summoned as Caster[^1] or even Assassin he would be the kindly old doctor Dutch doctor who spoke in comically broken English, as shown in the novel. Or if summoned as a more combat orientated class like an Archer he would be similar to the vampire slaying expert we are often shown in popular culture, having a harder personality and a more youthful look.

It's just a rambling example, but considering how Van Helsing is often portrayed as a massive hero I think it could work rather well within the context of the series.

[^1]: Casters don't necessarily have to be wizards, for example [William Shakespeare](http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Caster_of_Red) can be summoned as a Caster despite the fact he cannot cast a single spell.
