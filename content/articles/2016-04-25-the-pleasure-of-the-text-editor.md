Ian Bogost, *The Atlantic*:

> True, they are still contained within the ungainly, draconian chrome of the websites and apps that have taken over the prior tyranny of Microsoft Office. But nevertheless and improbably, the text editor has won out over the word processor: Text, free from layout, one word after the next as your fingers tap keys or screens.

Can confirm text editors are the way to go. For three years now I've written everything in a text editor with markdown, including this post, and it's never failed me once.
