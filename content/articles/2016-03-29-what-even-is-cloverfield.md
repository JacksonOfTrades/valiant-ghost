Toussaint Egan, Kill Screen:

> And then it happened. A primal roar bellows from out of the Earth. Calamity ensues. The night sky clots with molten shards of debris, crashing to the earth in fits. Hand-held footage spasms sharply before cutting to black. Then an ominous projectile whirrs and ricochets into a packed Manhattan street as a huddled mass of onlookers cries out in disbelief. The Statue of Liberty has been defamed by decapitation. A date— ‘1-18-08’— pulsates ominously across the screen before vanishing as abruptly as it appeared.

> *Cloverfield* (2008), as a film, is inextricable from the marketing that preceded it, indebted to that mystique attributed to the stewardship of one J.J. Abrams. Say what you will about his hit-or-miss track record as a showrunner of television action-dramas, there’s one quality as a producer that Abrams has ingrained so intuitively well—it has become the defining mark of his professional success. Simply put, he understands that much of the appeal of a story is more in how it is told, and not necessarily in what is being told. He’s a seasoned architect of expectations, synonymous with expository puzzle-boxes and red herrings, luring audiences into theaters as if it were the answer to a riddle. And he’s good at it.


> Away from all that, *Cloverfield*is entertaining genre fiction in its own right: a monster movie that lingers less on its titular American-bred kaiju and more on the physical and spiritual devastation that it leaves in its wake. That the film is the product of a post-9/11 world is of little debate, and it arguably stands as one of the best to emulate the totality of existential shellshock that haunts the aftermath of such a horrific event. For all its grating, half-baked dialogue and incredulous reliance on the framing device of T.J. Miller’s “camera work,” *Cloverfield*’s emphasis on the faux-documentation of its core cast’s reactionary panic and spur-of-the-moment sleuthing echoes the spirit of cinéma vérité. It’s a raw, messy attempt to depict that most inexplicable of tragedies, the devastating loss and displacement of human life amidst a catastrophe.

I still remember the first time I saw Cloverfield. I was sick that day, and my Mum went and rented a few movies for us. Among them was Cloverfield, and I remember loving every second of it[^1] and it left me with so many questions, and from there I loved movies.

[1]: I also remember fondly going to play with a Lego Star Wars ship I had previously spent a few hours building and dropping it on the hard wood floor. Ah memories...
