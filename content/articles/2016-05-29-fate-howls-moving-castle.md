As I've [written before](https://valiantghost.com/2016/04/abraham-van-helsing-servant-fate-series/), in the Fate series characters from books are free game to become servants. And due to this I'm going to need Howl's Moving Castle in Fate/Grand Order, with as much Studio Ghilbi-ness as possible. 

Howl would make a great Caster, with his Castle come down and destroy the enemy for an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm. Both Calcifer and Turnip Head would fit solidly in the universe as well. I would even love something as simple as a Fate/Grand Order event centered around the events of the novel/film.
