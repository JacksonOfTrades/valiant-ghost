With the new Star Wars movie out, there has been a rise in Star Wars parody accounts. I decided to make a list of my favorites here.

### [Glum George Lucas](https://twitter.com/glumgeorgelucas)

Glum George Lucas: complaining about what the new Star Wars needs badly. My favorite:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Criticize the prequels all you want, but I always stayed true to my main goal:&#10;&#10;To sell lots of toys.&#10;&#10;Wait, I mean to tell a great story.</p>&mdash; Glum George Lucas (@GlumGeorgeLucas) <a href="https://twitter.com/GlumGeorgeLucas/status/685119755267784704">January 7, 2016</a></blockquote>

I'm sure you know of this account anyway, considering it's popularity but I thought it should be included anyway.
