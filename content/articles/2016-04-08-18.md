Huh, that's Chaika season 1 down. And it only took me... five days! Well, I flew through that. Anyway, I would recommend Chaika to anyone. The last episode was good, dragongirl briefly became even more adorable then she previously was. Also romance. And awesome music. Perfect way to wrap up the season. Plus it looks like in the next season Tooru might get the anime buff he was due for.
