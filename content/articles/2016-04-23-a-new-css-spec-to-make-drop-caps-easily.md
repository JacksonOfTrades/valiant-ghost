title: A new CSS spec to make drop caps easily

Ian Yates writes about a new W3C spec which will make drop caps easily used with CSS: 

> The `initial-letter` property, currently [being discussed as an Editor’s Draft by the W3C](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-inline/#sizing-drop-initials) (about as early on in the standardising process as it’s possible to be), aims to give us the precise typographic control we want. It’s used in combination with `first-letter`.

I personally would love this to become a web standard, mostly so I can stop copying the same CSS just to get the same drop cap effect whenever I play around in a website. I probably wouldn't integrate it here, but I would still love to mess around with it.

For more drop cappy goodness, you should check out [The Daily Drop Cap](http://www.dailydropcap.com/), a now abandoned project which I've covered here before. I still love it.
