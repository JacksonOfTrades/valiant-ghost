title: The trouble with Superman

For the upcoming Superman vs Batman movie, *The Atlantic* has written an article on how Superman is for most parts... boring.

> The problem DC faced was this: You can’t fix something if you’re not sure where it’s broken. One of the issues halting a successful reinvention of Superman is a shift in the nature of the comics market. Since the 1980s, the dominant trend in the industry has been specialty comics shops replacing newsstands as primary distributors. Given this change, companies like Marvel and DC have focused their marketing toward an ever-dwindling market of adult fans, darkening their characters in an attempt to keep the interest of a readership desperate for mainstream respectability. In effect, adults were colonizing young-adult narratives and warping them in the process—an early example of what later occurred with Michael Bay’s legendarily crass Transformers films.



> In one of the uglier paradoxes of the superhero-comics industry, characters who were devised to entertain children soon became completely unsuitable for them. Leaning into this trend in an effort to entice new adult readers, DC largely abandoned its strengths as a publisher of optimistic, bizarre superheroics and fumbled for an edgier identity. Aspirational characters were hit hard by this change—Wonder Woman in particular has suffered nearly as many reboots as Superman, the latest of which has cast her as the bloodthirstiest of her Justice League coworkers, her trademark lasso of truth traded for a sword.



> But the trend proved particularly damaging to the Man of Steel. The 1986 *Dark Knight Returns*, one of the landmark wave of “mature” superhero comics, cast him as a Reaganite stooge and ended with Batman knocking him out. The choice directly shadowed Superman’s history up until the present. The dour trailers for*Batman v Superman* draw directly from the imagery of *The Dark Knight Returns*, with several shots paralleling panels from the earlier comic. The effect is to shout for everybody watching: This is a serious film. [Pointedly, in these trailers Superman never once smiles.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro)



> In fact, it’s hard to escape the impression that Superman’s own company finds him a bit embarrassing. As the comics writer Chris Sims [points out in his review](http://comicsalliance.com/superman-a-celebration-of-75-years-review-dc/)of the anniversary compilation *Superman: A Celebration of 75 Years*, DC’s company line on Superman seems to be that he’s “a depressed sad sack who never wins.” The company ditched his iconic red trunks in 2011 and placed him instead in the blue, armor-like suit he currently wears on film. In response to fan complaints that Superman was “too powerful” and thus boring, it constantly adjusted his level of strength.

*Disclosure: I am a Batman guy.*

Ah yes, Superman. The hero who has never sat quite right with me. I've never been a comic guy, but Batman was always my choice of hero when I needed to pick one. 

Because Batman is a normal guy under the suit. Sure he's a playboy billionaire, but he can't punch the sun or anything like that. No, if Batman's going to fight somebody he's going to do it the old fashioned way, if hes flying hes flying in a jet, if hes fighting hes fighting with his fists and gadgets, not his insane powers. Batman actually has limitations, weaknesses. He's human, while Superman isn't.

I suppose in a way you could compare Superman to Saitama from [One Punch Man](http://myanimelist.net/anime/30276)1. Both are insanely powerful to the point that we petty mortals could never achieve. But Saitama has his faults. While Superman is universally accepted Saitama is ignored, even when he does a heroic feat. While Superman got his powers just from how he was born, Saitama had to work for them[^2]. He's human, relatable even if he's over powered.

So yeah, I don't like Superman. *Long live Batman!*
