Zack Kotzer, *Kill Screen*: 

> “The *Persona* series addresses problems that people hold deep in their hearts,” said Katsura Hashino, the series’ director since *Persona 3* (2006). “They’re not just playing the game as a form of escapism.” Hashino calls his games meditations on the “true self,” and the repercussions that come with suppressing it. Psychology pioneer Carl Jung considered the “persona” to be a mask of character traits worn to conform to societal rules, with one’s true self-being the wearer of that mask. By combining pop culture with academic theories like[ Jung’s collective unconscious](http://www.carl-jung.net/collective_unconscious.html), Hashino’s games ask players to face their most ancient fears and desires in a modern context.
