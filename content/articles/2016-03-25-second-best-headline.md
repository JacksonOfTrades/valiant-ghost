Helena Horton, *The Telegraph*:

> A day after Microsoft introduced an innocent Artificial Intelligence chat robot to Twitter it has had to delete it after it transformed into an evil Hitler-loving, incestual sex-promoting, 'Bush did 9/11'-proclaiming robot. 

This clashes with *'[Russian sailor drank half a litre of rum before crashing 7,000-ton ship full speed into Scotland](/2015/11/drink-and-sail/)'* for the best headline ever.
