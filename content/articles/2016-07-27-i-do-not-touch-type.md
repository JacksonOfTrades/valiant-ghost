A lot of people ask how I touch type so fast when they see me work. 

I do not touch type. Compared to the graceful sniper shots of touch typing my typing is like a machine gun rattling across the battlefield. It is not the very graceful movements of the touch typists I know, but rather it is a skill bought to incredibly speed by near constant repetition: Nearly every day spent in front of a computer since I was four has left me with these skills. 

Watching my hands as I type these words, a skill I have long since lost the need for, my hand movements are long different from how I was taught to touch type but never bothered to learn. The spacebar is hit with my pointer finger rather than my thumbs, and my right hand occasionally crosses over the left of my keyboard in order to hit some key because my other hands are occupied. 

Not at all graceful as touch typing should be. This is... Jackson Wyndow typing. It's different but it works.
