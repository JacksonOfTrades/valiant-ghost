>Of the billions of uploads to Flickr in 2015, these 25 images represent the most beautiful, dynamic, and engaging photography from our global community.

> Weâ€™ve compiled this list based on a number of engagement and community factors. The photos were scored by an algorithm that calculates a combination of social and interactive elements, including how often the photo had been faved and viewed, among numerous others.
