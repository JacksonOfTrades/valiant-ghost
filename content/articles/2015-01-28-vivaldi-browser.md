I could see this being useful to me personally. Especially for doing research for this site. Some days I might have 2 tabs open, sometimes I might have 20. Simply being able to pin them into a stack would be helpful as hell. Another plus is its based on Opera, a browser I love but came into my life too late after I had already set up a nice, Add-on filled browser in Chrome.

If I feel the need to, I might write a review on it.
