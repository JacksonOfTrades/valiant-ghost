From [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/4bd03r/saturn_v_fuel_consumption_in_elephants/), how much fuel consumption does the Saturn V rocket take in the wildly inaccurate measurement. Just like today how my friend asked me how rich my dad was on a scale from him (0 dollars) to Donald Trump.

Although the link does point out that the gif is wildly inaccurate so ```¯\_(ツ)_/¯```.
