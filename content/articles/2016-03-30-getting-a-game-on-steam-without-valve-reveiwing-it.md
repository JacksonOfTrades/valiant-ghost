A user/developer tried to release the game 'Watch Paint Dry' on Steam, which is literally just a video of watching paint dry, and actually succeeded, using a number of security loopholes

> This is no more than a prank and was merely to test something I’ve been trying to report to Valve for the past few months — the ability to get any game you want on Steam, without Valve ever even having a look at it. This is an already outdated guide as Valve have fixed these issues, but if you were to travel back in time then this is a definitive guide on how to release your game! Just another quick note, this is nothing to do with the film censorship protest- I only found out about that today, this doesn’t have as much “meaning” behind it.

Here you can get a basic insight into how terrible Steam has become over the past couple of years. If anything Steams Greenlight system seriously needs a revamp for getting quality games out there, similar to how Apple vets their app store. I don't like Apple, and how long it often takes apps to get through, but this is the obvious advantage. Everything is vetted for quality before you can even download it.
