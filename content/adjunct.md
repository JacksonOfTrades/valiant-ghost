> "It's like Reddit [TIL](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/) as a blog"

Since 2014, Valiant Ghost has been the irregularly scheduled weblog of Jackson Wyndow. The editorial direction of the website is vague, especially as this site also operates as a linkblog half the time and as a microblog. But it often focuses on the area of design and web design, anime and 'culture', that good old blanket term. Oh and [Fate, lots of Fate](https://valiantghost.com/tags/fate/). 

## About Jackson

Hi, my name is Jackson Wyndow[^2]. I'm located somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere and I have an interest in photography, web design, coffee, writing and programming[^3]. You can follow my photographical exploits[^4] on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/manotheclassics/) and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/136705595@N02/), and my [personal Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ManOTheClassics), where I let the side of me which is more 'Otaku' come out.

## Assorted Nerdery

Valiant Ghost is published using [Middleman](middlemanapp.com/) with the [blogging extension](middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/). The design of this site is done completely by myself, but I use [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/) to try and make this site not look as bad as it would if I designed it without any extra resources. All of my posts are written in [Typora](http://www.typora.io/) and the code is written with [Brackets](http://brackets.io).

Hosting is provided by [Heroku](https://heroku.com), because I'm yet to find another platform that lets me deploy static sites [from mobile](https://valiantghost.com/2016/02/heroku-middleman/). I track you (Sorry, but at least until I can get ads here) with [Piwik](http://piwik.org/). 

On a modern browser, the fonts are Libre Baskerville and Open Sans. I like Baskerville because I like the weight of the font compared to a font like Merriweather or Alegreya. Open Sans is, to my mind, one of the most readable free San Serif fonts around.

Like every other modern weblog engine today, I write damn nearly everything in Markdown, specifically [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) so footnotes work. I would use [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/) if Middleman supported it, but that doesn't seem likely anytime soon. Speaking of footnotes the little pop-up bubble footnotes are provided by [Bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com/), which I really recommend for any blog or publication that uses footnotes heavily like I do.

## Contact

Is the site broken? Do links take you to some mysterious Russian site telling you to download a new version of Java? Do fonts render in the dreaded <span style= "font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;"><i><b>comic sans?</b></i></span> First, make sure your not using Internet Explorer. If the answer is yes, get a better browser. 

Valiant Ghost is best viewed with a pair of human eyes and a shot of tequila.

If the answer is no, please contact me and I will fix it as soon as possible.

[^1]: Hello!
[^2]: Yes, it's pronounced just like the big glass sheets. Make any puns. I've heard 'em all.
[^3]: Which is the main reason I run this.
[^4]: Not a word but I'm sticking with it.
