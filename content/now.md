What the heck is this page about?  [Click here.](http://nownownow.com/about) 

* Playing around with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), my new CMS for this site. It's a hell of a lot better than Middleman has been for me in the past few months.
* Reading more Terry Pratchett, Stephen King's *The Stand* and Fate/Apocrypha Volume 2.
* Playing Pok√©mon Go :)
* Trying to get iA Writer working on Windows *without* a full fledged Android emulator.  
* Listening to a number of podcasts, including [aaaPodcast](http://www.aaapodcast.com) which I am really enjoying.
